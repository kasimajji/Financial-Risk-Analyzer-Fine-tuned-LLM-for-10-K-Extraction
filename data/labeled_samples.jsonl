Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially harmed. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Risk Factor Summary This risk factor summary contains a high-level summary of risks associated with our business, but does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized below, and other risks that we face, may be found immediately following this summary. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry \u2022We have a history of losses and may not achieve profitability in the future. \u2022The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results as well as the business and operations of our customers and potential customers. \u2022Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our platform over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. \u2022Our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance. \u2022We have a limited operating history and our business has evolved, which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results. \u2022We have experienced rapid growth and significant changes to our organization and structure and may not be able to effectively manage such growth. \u2022Failure to adequately maintain and scale our sales force will impede our growth. \u2022We have expanded and intend to continue to expand our international operations, which exposes us to significant risks. \u2022Our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with existing and prospective Knowledge Network application providers. \u2022We do not have a long history with our pricing models and changes could adversely affect our operating results. \u2022Our success depends on a fragmented internet environment for finding information, particularly information about businesses. \u2022Our platform faces competition in the marketplace. If we are unable to compete effectively, our operating results could be adversely affected. \u2022Business and professional service providers may not widely adopt our platform to manage their information or as an important part of their marketing strategy, which would limit our ability to grow our business. \u2022If customers do not renew their subscriptions for our platform or if they reduce their subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. \u2022If we are unable to attract new customers, our revenue growth could be slower than we expect and our business may be harmed. \u2022If we fail to integrate our platform with a variety of third-party technologies, our platform may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete and our operating results would be harmed. \u2022If we are unable to successfully develop and market new features, make enhancements to our existing features, or expand our offerings into new markets, our business, results of operations and competitive position may suffer. \u2022If we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs or requirements, our platform may become less competitive. \u2022If customers do not expand their use of our platform beyond their current subscriptions and licenses, our ability to grow our business and operating results may be adversely affected. \u2022Because our platform is sold to enterprises that often have complex operating environments, we may encounter long and unpredictable sales cycles, which could adversely affect our operating results in any given period. \u2022A portion of our revenue is dependent on a few customers. \u2022A significant portion of our revenue is dependent on third-party reseller customers, the efforts of which we do not control. \u2022Adverse economic conditions or reduced technology spending may adversely impact our business. \u2022We may require additional capital to support our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Risks Related to Information Technology, Intellectual Property, and Data Security \u2022A security breach, network attack or information security incident could delay or interrupt service to our customers, result in the unauthorized access to, or use, modification or publishing of customer content or other information, harm our reputation or subject us to significant liability. \u2022Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and harm our business and operating results. \u2022We could incur substantial costs in protecting or defending our intellectual property rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \u2022Our platform utilizes open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business. \u2022We employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our platform, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which could adversely affect our business. \u2022The reliability of our network and support infrastructure will be critical to our success. Sustained failures or outages could lead to significant costs and service disruptions, which could negatively affect our business, financial results and reputation. \u2022Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our software, or in the software or systems of our third-party application providers and partners, could materially and adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects. Risks Related to Laws, Regulation and Taxation \u2022We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, including those related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Our Status as a Public Company \u2022Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. \u2022The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and may decline. Market volatility may affect the value of an investment in our common stock and could subject us to litigation. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry We have a history of losses and may not achieve profitability in the future. We generated a net loss of $94.7 million, $121.5 million and $74.8 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of January 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $517.3 million, reflecting our losses recognized historically on a GAAP basis. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods to become profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. As a result, we may continue to experience operating losses for the indefinite future. Further, we expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we hire additional personnel, incur additional expenses associated with our new and expanded facilities, expand our distribution channels, develop our technology and new features and face increased compliance costs associated with our growth and entry into new markets and geographies and operations as a public company. If our revenue does not increase to offset these and other potential increases in operating expenses, we may not be profitable in future periods. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our common stock may significantly decrease. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results as well as the business and operations of our customers and potential customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted business operations for us and our customers, suppliers, vendors and other parties with whom we do business and such disruptions are expected to continue for an indefinite period of time. In an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, governments and municipalities around the world have instituted restrictive measures, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions, and mandated business closures. The pandemic and resulting governmental restrictions and regulations have adversely affected businesses, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn, a sharp increase in unemployment and increased market volatility. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the operation of our business has been disrupted. We have temporarily closed our offices requiring all employees globally to work remotely. We have restricted non-essential business travel and canceled in-person marketing events, including our annual industry and customer event ONWARD20. While we continue to monitor regional developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic to inform decisions on office re-openings and lifting of travel restrictions, these efforts may not be successful and may require additional costs. The uncertain duration of these measures have had and may continue to have increasingly negative effects on our sales efforts and revenue growth rates. In addition, our management team has, and will likely continue, to spend time, attention and resources monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking to manage its effects on our business and workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and we believe will continue to have a negative impact on our sales activities including our ability to attract, retain and sell additional products and features to our customers. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic some existing and potential customers, in particular among those in industries highly impacted by the pandemic, such as retail and food services as well as certain geographies such as Europe, have and we expect other customers may reduce, suspend or delay technology spending, request to renegotiate contracts to obtain concessions such as extended billing and payment terms, shorten the duration of contracts or elect not to renew their subscriptions. If additional customers or potential customers take similar actions, our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted. Because our platform is offered as a subscription-based service and we generally recognize revenue from our customer contracts ratably over the term of the contract, changes in our contracting activity in the near term may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. The COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to control its spread may adversely affect other aspects of our business as described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. As a result of the scale of the pandemic and measures taken to control its spread, our financial and operating results have been adversely affected and may differ materially from our historical results, and such adverse results may continue or worsen. Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our platform over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their agreements, which are typically one year in length but may be up to three years or longer in length. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our products or a decline in our retention rate, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may not be fully apparent or reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance. We experienced revenue growth rates of 34% from the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, 31% from the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, and 19% from the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. Our historical revenue growth rates are not indicative of future growth, and we may not achieve similar revenue growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth. Our operating results may vary as a result of a number of factors, including our ability to execute on our business strategy, our ability to compete effectively for customers and business partners, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other factors that are outside of our control. If we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, our stock price could be volatile, and it could be difficult to achieve or maintain profitability. We have a limited operating history and our business has evolved, which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results. We were incorporated in 2006 and originally operated as an advertising services company. Our business has evolved several times since then. For example, we sold our advertising business to IAC/InterActiveCorp in 2012 and over the following years have become a platform that puts businesses in control of their facts online with their official answers in search. Many of the most popular features of our platform have only been launched in the past few years. As a result of our limited operating history and recent changes to our platform and our sales model, our ability to forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model our future growth. The dynamic nature of our business and our industry may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, and as a result our historical performance should not be considered indicative of our future performance. We have encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. In addition, the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and industry are uncertain and introduce additional uncertainty to our forecasts of future operating results. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change due to changes in our industry, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer. We have experienced rapid growth and significant changes to our organization and structure and may not be able to effectively manage such growth. Our headcount and operations have grown substantially in recent years. We increased the number of our full-time employees from over 450 as of January 31, 2016 to over 1,300 as of January 31, 2021 and have hired several members of our senior management team in recent years. We believe that our corporate culture has been a critical component of our success. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team and nurturing our culture. As we expand our business and operate as a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture while managing our personnel growth. Any failure to manage our anticipated growth and organizational changes in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our culture could hurt our chance for future success, including our ability to recruit and retain personnel and effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. Furthermore, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our corporate culture may be difficult to maintain as all our global offices are temporarily closed and all employees globally work from home. In addition, to manage the growth of our headcount, customer-base and operations, we will need to continue to improve our information technology infrastructure and our operational, financial and management systems and procedures. We have implemented many of these systems and procedures only recently, and they may not work as we expect or at all. Our anticipated additional headcount and capital investments will increase our costs, which will make it more difficult for us to address any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. However, to the extent we cannot scale our information technology infrastructure, we will continue to rely on manual processes that are costly, inefficient and subject to error. Finally, in order to successfully manage our rapid growth, our organizational structure has become more complex. We have added personnel and may need to continue to scale and adapt our operational, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit additional financial, operational and management resources before our revenue increases and without any assurances that our revenue will increase. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we likely will be unable to successfully execute our business strategy, which could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Failure to adequately maintain and scale our sales force will impede our growth. Our revenue growth is substantially reliant on our sales force. Much of our sales process is relationship-driven, which requires a significant sales force. While we plan to maintain and scale our direct sales force, both domestically and internationally, we have historically had difficulty recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of sales personnel. If we are unable to adequately scale our sales force, we will not be able to reach our market potential and execute our business plan. Identifying and recruiting qualified sales personnel and training them on our products requires significant time, expense and attention. Our financial results will suffer if our efforts to scale and train our direct sales force do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue. We have hired a significant number of direct sales personnel in recent years. If new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or if we are unable to retain and develop talented sales personnel, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or increase our revenue. We have expanded and intend to continue to expand our international operations, which exposes us to significant risks. In 2014, we opened our first office outside the United States, and we intend to continue to expand our operations abroad. Our international expansion has created and will create significant challenges for our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks in addition to those we already face in the United States. Because of our limited experience with international operations and developing and managing sales in international markets, our international expansion efforts may not be successful. Some of the specific risks we will face in conducting business internationally that could adversely affect our business include: \u2022the difficulty of recruiting and managing international operations and the increased operations, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with numerous international locations; \u2022our ability to effectively price our multi-tiered subscriptions in competitive international markets; \u2022our ability to identify and manage sales partners; \u2022new and different sources of competition in each country or region; \u2022potentially greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; \u2022the need to adapt and localize our products for specific countries, including differences in the location attributes and formats used in each country and differences in languages, for example in the case of our site search product, which relies on natural language processing; \u2022the need to develop integrations with new third-party applications used by international customers; \u2022the need to offer customer support in various languages; \u2022difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions; \u2022compliance with U.S. laws and regulations for foreign operations, including, without limitation, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance; \u2022compliance with international laws and regulations, including without limitation, those governing privacy, data security and data transfer, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which may impair our ability to grow our business or offer our service in some locations, may subject us to liability for non-compliance or may require us to change our business practices; \u2022expanded demands on, and distraction of, senior management; \u2022difficulties with differing technical and environmental standards, data privacy and telecommunications regulations and certification requirements outside the United States; \u2022varying levels of internet technology adoption and infrastructure; \u2022tariffs and other non-tariff barriers, such as quotas and local content rules; \u2022more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; \u2022adverse tax consequences; \u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the price of our products outside of the United States, increase the expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk; \u2022currency control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit our conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars; \u2022restrictions on the transfer of funds; \u2022deterioration of political relations between the United States and other countries; \u2022natural disasters, pandemics including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, acts of terrorism and other events beyond our control; and \u2022political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region in which we operate, which could have an adverse impact on our operations in that location. Also, our network service provider fees outside of the United States are generally higher than domestic rates, and our gross margin may be affected and may fluctuate as we expand our operations and customer base worldwide. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations, and adversely affect our overall business, operating results and financial condition. Some of our customers and Knowledge Network application providers also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if these customers and application providers are not able to successfully manage these risks. Our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with existing and prospective Knowledge Network application providers. We have established strategic relationships with approximately 200 third-party service and application providers that comprise our Knowledge Network, including Amazon Alexa, Apple Maps, Bing, Cortana, Facebook, Google, Google Assistant, Google Maps, Siri, Yelp and many others. These application providers provide us with direct access to update content on their websites and applications. This direct access enables us to control our customers' business listings on the Knowledge Network application providers' websites and applications and to push real-time or nearly real-time updates to those business listings. In order to maintain relationships with application providers, we may need to modify our products or strategies in a way that may be adverse to our business and financial results. Furthermore, if we were to lose access to these applications, either in whole or in part, our Knowledge Network would not be as efficient, accurate or competitive. Our customers may also place a significant value on particular application providers such as Google such that the termination or impairment of our relationship with one or a limited number of application providers could lead to a loss of a significant number of customers. In order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will need to continue to maintain and potentially expand these relationships. We may be unsuccessful in renegotiating our agreements with these third-party application providers or third-party application providers may insist on fees to access their applications. Additionally, our contracts with these third-party application providers may be canceled after a notice period or may not be renewed, and we could lose access to these resources without having sufficient time to replace them. We believe we will also need to establish new relationships with third-party application providers, including third-party application providers in new geographic markets that we enter, and third-party application providers that may emerge in the future as leading sources of information about businesses for end consumers. Identifying potential third-party application providers, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. Our competitors may be more effective than we are in providing incentives to application providers to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our products. In addition, the acquisition of a competitor by one of our third-party application providers could result in the termination of our relationship with that third-party application provider, which, in turn, could lead to decreased customer subscriptions. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third-party application providers, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could suffer. We do not have a long history with our pricing models and changes could adversely affect our operating results. We have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices and contract length for our platform. For example, we recently began offering capacity-based pricing for our Pages and Answers products. There is no assurance that this new pricing and distribution model will be successful thus adversely affecting our financial results. Furthermore, as the markets for our features grow, as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours or reduce their prices, or as we enter into new international markets, we may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers at the same price. Moreover, large customers, which have historically been the focus of our direct sales efforts, may demand greater price discounts. As we expand internationally, we also must determine the appropriate price to enable us to compete effectively internationally. In addition, if the mix of features we sell changes, then we may need to, or choose to, revise our pricing. As a result, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices or offer shorter contract durations, which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial condition and cash flow. Our success depends on a fragmented internet environment for finding information, particularly information about businesses. We believe that our platform offers value to our customers in part because of the difficulty for a customer to update information about their business across many websites and apps, many of which are owned or controlled by different entities and receive information from a variety of sources. Industry consolidation or technological advancements could result in a small number of websites or applications emerging as the predominant sources of information about businesses, thereby creating a less fragmented internet environment for purposes of end consumer searches about businesses. Additionally, we may enter new geographies with less fragmented internet environments. If most end consumers relied on a few websites or applications for this information, or if reliably accurate information across the most used websites and applications were generated from a single source, the need to synchronize information about a business and for our platform could decline significantly. In particular, if larger providers of internet services were able to consolidate or control key websites and apps from which end consumers seek information about businesses, including regarding physical locations, other entities and attributes, our platform may become less necessary or attractive to our customers, and our revenue would suffer accordingly. Our platform faces competition in the marketplace. If we are unable to compete effectively, our operating results could be adversely affected. The market for our features is competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and is subject to changing technology and shifting customer needs. Many vendors develop and market products and services that compete to varying extents with our features, and we expect competition in our market to intensify. Moreover, industry consolidation may increase competition. Additionally, new entrants, specifically application providers, that enter our markets through acquisitions or otherwise, would increase competition in our markets significantly. As we develop our platform, we will introduce products and features that compete in new markets and as a result we will face new competitors. For example, in October 2019 we launched Answers, our site search product, which competes with other search products. We currently face many competitors with a variety of product offerings. These companies have developed, or are developing, products that currently, or in the future are likely to, compete with some or all of our features. Also, a number of potential new competitors, including those with longer operating histories, greater name recognition, more established customer bases or significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, may decide to create or acquire products that compete with our platform or products or we may develop products that compete with their existing platforms. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new features to existing competitive products, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, form strategic alliances with other companies or are acquired by third parties with greater available resources. If our competitors' products, services or technologies become more accepted than our features, if they are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than we bring our features to market, or if their products or services are more technologically capable than our features, then our revenue growth could be adversely affected. Certain of our existing and new competitors have or may develop technologies and services that compete with specific products or features in our platform seeking to be best-in-class. To the extent our customers or potential customers choose to work with several of these vendors rather than implement our platform, our revenue growth could be adversely affected. In addition, some of our competitors offer their products and services at a lower price. If we are unable to achieve our target pricing levels, our margins and operating results could be negatively affected. Business and professional service providers may not widely adopt our platform to manage their information or as an important part of their marketing strategy, which would limit our ability to grow our business. Our ability to grow our business and increase revenue depends on our success in educating businesses and professional service providers about the potential benefits of our cloud-based platform. Cloud applications for organizing and managing information about a business, particularly for their locations, entities and attributes, have not previously been widely adopted. Concerns about cost, security, reliability and other issues may cause businesses and professional service providers not to adopt our platform. Moreover, businesses and professional service providers who have already invested substantial resources in other marketing strategies and data management systems or methods may be reluctant to adopt a new approach like ours to supplement or replace existing systems or methods. If businesses and professional service providers do not widely adopt software such as ours, our ability to grow our business will be limited. If customers do not renew their subscriptions for our platform or if they reduce their subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our platform after the expiration of their subscription periods. In the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew their subscriptions with us. Our customers may seek to renew their subscriptions for fewer features, at renegotiated rates, or for shorter contract lengths, all of which could reduce the amount of the subscription. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including limited customer resources, changes in our pricing and subscription models, customer satisfaction with our platform, the acquisition of our customers by other companies and deteriorating general economic conditions. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic certain customers have reduced their subscriptions, elected not to renew their subscriptions, reduced length of contracts, requested extended billing and payment terms or sought more favorable rates. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our platform or decrease the amounts they spend with us, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. If our renewal rates fall significantly below the expectations of the public market, equity research analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could also be harmed. If we are unable to attract new customers, our revenue growth could be slower than we expect and our business may be harmed. To increase our revenue, we must add new customers. If competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with our features, our ability to sell our features based on factors such as pricing, technology and functionality could be impaired. As a result, we may be unable to attract new customers at rates or on terms that would be favorable or comparable to prior periods, which could negatively affect the growth of our revenue. Furthermore, we have canceled in-person customer and industry events including ONWARD, our annual industry and customer event, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also allocated marketing resources to focus on virtual events, virtual lead generation, and tools to help our sales personnel connect virtually with customers and potential customers. These new marketing efforts may not be successful and may not attract as many new customers as our historical customer and industry events, which could harm our future revenue and revenue growth. If we fail to integrate our platform with a variety of third-party technologies, our platform may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete and our operating results would be harmed. Our platform must integrate with a variety of third-party technologies, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our platform to adapt to changes in cloud-enabled hardware, software, networking, mobile, browser and database technologies. Any failure of our platform to operate effectively with future technologies could reduce the demand for our platform, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our business. If we are unable to respond to these changes in a cost-effective and timely manner, our platform may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete and our operating results may be negatively affected. In addition, an increasing number of customers are utilizing mobile devices to access the internet and conduct business. If we cannot continue to effectively make our platform available on these mobile devices and offer the information, services and functionality required by enterprises that widely use mobile devices, we may experience difficulty attracting and retaining customers, which could negatively affect our revenue. If we are unable to successfully develop and market new features, make enhancements to our existing features, or expand our offerings into new markets, our business, results of operations and competitive position may suffer. The software industry is subject to rapid technological change and evolving standards and practices, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers depends, in part, on our ability to enhance and improve our existing features, increase adoption and usage of our platform and introduce new products and features, including Yext Answers. We expend significant resources on research and development to enhance our platform and to incorporate additional features, improve functionality or add other enhancements in order to meet our customers' rapidly evolving demands. The success of any enhancements or new features depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, actual performance quality, market-accepted pricing levels and overall market acceptance. We may not be successful in these efforts, which could result in significant expenditures that could impact our revenue or distract management's attention from current offerings. Increased emphasis on the sale and development of new features could distract us from other parts of the business and the development and sale of our core platform, negatively affecting our overall sales. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, features, services, and technologies. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including insufficient revenue from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments, distraction of management from current operations, failure to adequately develop and enhance existing products and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new strategies and offerings are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that they will be successful. As we enhance our platform and develop new features, our platform has also become increasingly sophisticated requiring additional technology, sales, customer support and professional services resources. In order for our customers to understand and derive value from these new products and features, we will need to devote additional resources to train our sales personnel and provide higher-quality customer support and professional services. In addition, as our software becomes more complex, we may fail to detect errors, bugs or vulnerabilities. Even if we are successful in these endeavors, diversifying our platform offerings will bring us more directly into competition with other providers that may be better established or have greater resources than we have. Our new features or enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including: \u2022delays in introducing new, enhanced or modified features; \u2022failure to accurately predict market demand or end consumer preferences; \u2022defects, errors or failures in any of our features or our platform; \u2022introduction of competing products; \u2022poor business conditions for our customers or poor general macroeconomic conditions; \u2022changes in legal or regulatory requirements, or increased legal or regulatory scrutiny, adversely affecting our platform; \u2022failure of our brand promotion activities or negative publicity about the performance or effectiveness of our existing features; and \u2022disruptions or delays in the availability and delivery of our platform. There is no assurance that we will successfully identify new opportunities or develop and bring new features to market on a timely basis, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our platform obsolete or noncompetitive, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results and compromise our ability to generate revenue. If our new features or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, or if our new features do not result in increased sales or subscriptions, our brand and competitive position will be impaired, our anticipated revenue growth may not be achieved and the negative impact on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the upfront technology and development, marketing, advertising and other expenses we may incur in connection with the new feature or enhancement. If we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs or requirements, our platform may become less competitive. Our future success depends on our ability to adapt and be innovative. To attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers, we need to continue to enhance and improve our offerings to meet customer needs at prices that our customers are willing to pay. Such efforts will require adding new functionality and responding to technological advancements, which will increase our research and development costs. If we are unable to develop new features that address our customers' needs, or to enhance and improve our platform in a timely manner, we may not be able to maintain or increase market acceptance of our platform. Our ability to grow is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. Access and use of our platform is provided via the cloud, which, itself, was disruptive to the previous enterprise software model. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver software and related applications at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, such technologies could adversely affect our ability to compete. If customers do not expand their use of our platform beyond their current subscriptions and licenses, our ability to grow our business and operating results may be adversely affected. Our ability to grow our business depends in part on our ability to encourage current and future customers to subscribe to our higher priced packages with more extensive features. If we fail to achieve market acceptance of new features, or if a competitor establishes a more widely adopted platform, our revenue and operating results will be harmed. In addition, customers may initially purchase licenses for only a portion of the locations or entities that comprise their business. If these customers do not expand the number of licenses managed with our platform, our revenue and operating results will be harmed. Because our platform is sold to enterprises that often have complex operating environments, we may encounter long and unpredictable sales cycles, which could adversely affect our operating results in any given period. Our ability to increase revenue and achieve profitability depends, in large part, on widespread acceptance of our platform by enterprises. As we target our sales efforts at these customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. As a result of the variability and length of the sales cycle, we have only a limited ability to forecast the timing of sales. A delay in or failure to complete sales could harm our business and financial results, and could cause our financial results to vary from period to period. Our sales cycle varies widely, reflecting differences in potential customers' decision-making processes, procurement requirements and budget cycles, and is subject to significant risks over which we have little or no control, including: \u2022customers' budgetary constraints and priorities; \u2022the timing of customers' budget cycles; \u2022the need by some customers for lengthy evaluations prior to purchasing products; and \u2022the length and timing of customers' approval processes. Our typical direct sales cycles for more substantial enterprise customers can often be long, and we expect that this lengthy sales cycle may continue or could even increase. In the large enterprise market, the customer\u2019s decision to use our platform may be an enterprise-wide decision or may require the approval of senior management, which may not only lengthen the sales cycle but also reduce the likelihood of completing a sale. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the operations of our customers making sales cycles more complex. Delayed and more complex sales cycles could cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer in a given period. If we cannot adequately scale our direct sales force, we will experience further delays in signing new customers, which could slow our revenue growth. A portion of our revenue is dependent on a few customers. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate of our top five customers accounted for approximately 9%, 11% and 14%, respectively, of our revenue. We anticipate that sales of our platform to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in future periods. If we were to lose any of our significant customers, our revenue could decline and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. These negative effects could be exacerbated by customer consolidation, changes in technologies or solutions used by customers, changes in demand for our features, selection of suppliers other than us, customer bankruptcies or customer departures from their respective industries, pricing competition or deviation from marketing and sales methods away from physical location retailing, any one of which may result in even fewer customers accounting for a high percentage of our revenue and reduced demand from any single significant customer. In addition, some of our customers have used, and may in the future use, the size and relative importance of their purchases to our business to require that we enter into agreements with more favorable terms than we would otherwise agree to, to obtain price concessions, or to otherwise restrict our business. A significant portion of our revenue is dependent on third-party reseller customers, the efforts of which we do not control. Third-party reseller customers comprise a significant portion of our revenue. In transactions with third-party reseller customers, we are only party to the transaction with the reseller and are not a party to the reseller's transaction with its customer, and we do not control the efforts of these resellers. Such resellers may elect not to renew their subscriptions with us or may elect to purchase significantly fewer licenses, which would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, our third-party reseller customers, which often sell to small and midsized organizations that can have liquidity and expense limitations, are also susceptible to global economic weakness and uncertainty, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See also \"-If customers do not renew their subscriptions for our platform or if they reduce their subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer.\" Lower demand from certain of our reseller customers has and may continue to result in them not renewing their subscriptions with us, purchasing fewer licenses, attempting to renegotiate contracts to obtain concessions and requesting extended billing and payment terms. Such an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results would not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, if third-party reseller customers merge or consolidate with other businesses, declare bankruptcy or depart from their respective industries, our business could be harmed. For example, consolidation among our third-party reseller customers may require us to renegotiate agreements on less favorable terms, including longer payment periods, or may lead to a termination of our agreements with these resellers. We may expend significant resources managing these relationships. Further, in some international markets, we grant certain reseller customers the exclusive right to sell our features. If those reseller customers to whom we have granted exclusive rights elect not to renew their subscriptions or to purchase significantly fewer licenses, then we may be unable to adequately address sales opportunities in that territory. If we are unable to maintain or replace our contractual relationships with our existing reseller customers, efficiently manage our relationships with them or establish new contractual relationships with other third parties, we may fail to retain customers or acquire potential new customers and may experience delays and increased costs in adding or replacing customers that were lost, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We previously identified and continue to identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We may fail to remediate the identified material weakness, identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, and as a result, investor confidence in us and the value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. As a public company, we are required to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. Under standards established by the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. In connection with the audit of the fiscal year 2019 consolidated financial statements, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in information technology general controls (\"IT General Controls\"). The deficiencies in IT General Controls also resulted in a conclusion that manual controls that rely on data produced by and maintained within these affected information technology systems and automated controls within these affected information technology systems across several of our significant classes of transactions were ineffective. Based on the nature of these deficiencies in IT General Controls, we concluded that the two material weaknesses from fiscal years prior to 2019 related to the revenue recognition process and financial close continued to exist as of January 31, 2019. As of January 31, 2020, we determined that these previously identified material weaknesses had been remediated. Notwithstanding, as of January 31, 2020, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting associated with processes to calculate, record and account for sales commissions. While we took steps toward remediating this material weakness in fiscal year 2021, the material weakness related to the sales commission process continued to exist as of January 31, 2021. We are taking steps to remediate this material weakness. However, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take to remediate the material weakness, and we may not ever be able to remediate the material weakness. For additional information regarding this material weakness and related remediation activities, see Item 9A. \"Controls and Procedures.\" If we are unable to successfully remediate the material weakness and otherwise establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence in us and the value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may discover other control deficiencies in the future, and we cannot assure you that we will not have a material weakness in future periods. Additionally, the process of designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting required to comply with Section 404 is time consuming, costly and complicated. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation and maintenance could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. Deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are identified in such assessments may be deemed to be material weaknesses or may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. We may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management's attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results. We have in the past acquired and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, features or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. Although we have previously acquired businesses, we have limited acquisition experience. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including: \u2022unanticipated liabilities associated with the acquisition; \u2022difficulty incorporating acquired technology and rights into our platform and of maintaining quality and security standards consistent with our brand; \u2022inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; \u2022incurrence of acquisition-related costs; \u2022difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business; \u2022difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business into our customers; \u2022diversion of our management's attention from other business concerns; \u2022adverse effects to our existing business relationships as a result of the acquisition; \u2022potential loss of key employees; \u2022use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and \u2022use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition. In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. If an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could adversely affect us. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, civil unrest, pandemics, acts of terrorism and other events beyond our control. While we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, natural disasters and other events could also make it difficult or impossible for us to continue operations, and could decrease demand for our platform. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic the operation of our business has been disrupted. We have temporarily closed our offices requiring all of our employees globally to work remotely. Our corporate headquarters is located in New York City, an area that was and continues to be significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have restricted non-essential business travel and canceled in-person marketing events, including our annual industry and customer event ONWARD. The duration of the business disruption and related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. However, a prolonged disruption to our operations may have a material adverse effect on our business reducing operational efficiency and increasing operational costs. In addition, our data centers are located in New Jersey and Texas and our cloud computing providers operate from facilities in northern Virginia, Frankfurt, Germany and Tokyo, Japan, making our business particularly susceptible to natural disasters and other catastrophic events in those areas. Any natural disaster or other event affecting our data centers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We depend on our senior management team and the loss of our chief executive officer, president or one or more key employees could adversely affect our business. Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers. In particular, two of our co-founders, Howard Lerman and Brian Distelburger, who serve as our Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively, are critical to our vision, strategic direction, feature innovation, culture and overall business success. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, services and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. For example during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we announced changes to the leadership team for our sales and research and development functions, and the departure of these key executives may disrupt strategic initiatives of these functions. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have a serious adverse effect on our business. The failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could prevent us from executing our business strategy. To execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. In particular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing cloud-based software, as well as for skilled information technology, sales, marketing, legal and accounting professionals, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the professionals we need. In the future, we may experience difficulty in hiring and difficulty in retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous software and other technology companies. Competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in the New York area. We may incur significant costs to attract and retain qualified personnel, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other technology companies before we capitalize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them. We also employ a number of foreign nationals on work visas, primarily under the H-1B visa. Current and future restrictions on the availability of visas or delays in the issuance of visas could impair our ability to employ skilled professionals, which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the software industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options or other equity incentives they are to receive in connection with their employment. If the price of our stock declines, or experiences significant volatility, our ability to attract or retain key employees will be adversely affected. Also, as employee options vest, we may have difficulty retaining key employees or may be required to grant larger equity awards from our equity plans, which would cause dilution. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our growth prospects could be severely harmed. If we fail to provide high-quality customer support and professional services, our business and reputation may suffer. High-quality customer support and professional services are important for the successful retention of existing customers. Providing support and services, including education, training, data cleansing and processing, ongoing support as well as custom development services, requires that our personnel have specific knowledge and expertise of our platform, making it more difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and to scale up these operations. The importance of high-quality customer support and professional services and the difficulty of hiring qualified personnel will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers and as our platform becomes more complex with the development more features and capabilities. If we do not provide effective and timely ongoing customer support and professional services, our ability to sell additional features to, or to retain, existing customers may suffer, and our reputation with existing or potential customers may be harmed. In addition, certain aspects of our customer support, for example data cleansing, are conducted manually and are subject to error. While there are processes designed to verify the accuracy of data, if information is not updated or matched correctly, our reputation may be harmed and we may be subject to liability. If we fail to continue to develop our brand, our business may suffer. We believe that continuing to develop and maintain awareness of our brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our platform and is an important element in attracting and retaining customers. Efforts to build our brand may involve significant expense and may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue at all, or in an amount sufficient to offset expenses we incur in building our brand. In addition, we sell our features to companies in a number of industries, including healthcare, retail and financial services. If we are not successful in building our brand, we may become identified with a single industry, which could make it more difficult for us to penetrate other industries. Promotion and enhancement of our brand will depend largely on our success in being able to provide high quality, reliable and cost-effective features. If customers do not perceive our platform as meeting their needs, or if we fail to market our platform effectively, we will likely be unsuccessful in creating the brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our platform. Adverse economic conditions or reduced technology spending may adversely impact our business. Our business depends on the overall demand for technology and on the economic performance of our current and prospective customers. In general, worldwide economic conditions may remain unstable, and these conditions would make it difficult for our customers, prospective customers and us to forecast and plan future business activities accurately, and they could cause our customers or prospective customers to reevaluate their decision to purchase our features. Weak global economic conditions, or a reduction in technology spending even if economic conditions stabilize, could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, lower prices for our platform, fewer subscriptions and lower or no growth. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting governmental restrictions and regulations have created additional uncertainty in the global economy and a sharp increase in unemployment. The prolonged uncertainty and weak economic conditions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic has led certain of our customers and potential customers to decrease the rate of their information technology spending, has adversely affected their ability or willingness to purchase our platform and has caused them to delay purchasing decisions or reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions, all of which adversely affected our operating results. In addition, the economies of countries in Europe have been experiencing weakness associated with high sovereign debt levels, weakness in the banking sector and uncertainty over the future of the European Union, including uncertainty regarding Brexit. We have operations, as well as current and potential new customers, throughout Europe. The European Union's economy also suffered a sharp downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and economic conditions in Europe and other key markets for our platform remain weak. As a result, we have experienced negative impacts on our sales activities in Europe. If such conditions deteriorate further, customers may delay or reduce their information technology spending. In addition, the legal, regulatory and economic impacts of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union in January 2020 are not fully known at this time. While the United Kingdom and the European Union have signed a EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, there are still many uncertainties and regulations applicable during the transition period will likely be amended and may diverge from European Union regulations. The outcome of these events may, among other things, increase the costs and complexity of our operations in Europe including our ability to hire and retain employees. Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. Our estimates of market opportunity, market size and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves our forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. Market opportunity and size estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. We had historically analyzed the size of our estimated total addressable market, solely with respect to locations, using data published by third parties as well as internally generated data and assumptions regarding our ability to generate revenue from those locations. We have not independently verified the estimate of locations published by third parties and cannot assure you of its accuracy or completeness. In addition, our estimated market size for location-related data was based on an assumed annual revenue per location. As we continue to develop new features, the methodology and assumptions used to estimate new market opportunities may differ materially from methodologies and assumptions previously used to estimate total addressable market with respect to locations. With the addition of new products and features including our search product, we are targeting and positioning our platform towards new markets. To estimate the size of these new markets and their growth rates, we have relied on historical estimates and forecasts provided by industry publications and other third-party sources, including Gartner. We have not independently verified these estimates published by third parties and cannot assure you of their accuracy or completeness. The target markets in which we operate are also subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk. Our customers as well as analysts, market participants, and others may disagree with our assessment of our target markets and we may never successfully compete in these markets. In addition, third parties may have different assessments of the size of the markets in which in our products compete. These estimates of total addressable market and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty, are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our total addressable market may be more difficult to estimate and subject to greater uncertainty as the assumptions and forecasts on which we and third-parties have based estimates may not reflect future trends. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth we forecast, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. Our management team has limited experience managing a public company. Our chief executive officer has limited experience managing a public company, interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. While our chief financial officer and certain other executives have such experience, our management team, as a whole, may not successfully or efficiently manage the ongoing transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management, particularly from our chief executive officer, and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. Our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of expense and intercompany transactions including loans denominated in foreign currencies. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses and other operating results, when re-measured, may differ materially from expectations. For example, a significant portion of our international revenue is derived from Europe including the United Kingdom. Our revenues and cash flows from these regions may be adversely affected as a result of weakness in the Euro or British Pound. In addition, our operating results are subject to fluctuation if our mix of U.S. and foreign currency denominated transactions and expenses changes in the future. Although in the future we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies might not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications. Additionally, as we anticipate growing our business further outside of the United States, the effects of movements in currency exchange rates will increase as our transaction volume outside of the United States increases. Our new credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility. On March 11, 2020, we replaced our existing revolving credit facility by entering into a new credit facility. Our new credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to transfer or dispose of assets, merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, acquire other companies, pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness and liens and enter into new businesses. We therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the consent of the lender or terminate the new credit facility, which may limit our operating flexibility. In addition, our new credit facility is secured by all of our assets and requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or sales to meet these financial covenants or pay the principal and interest on any such debt. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to repay or refinance any such debt. Any inability to make scheduled payments or meet the financial covenants on our new credit facility would adversely affect our business. Loans under our new credit facility bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate based on LIBOR (or any such successor benchmark rate) or a base rate. It is unclear whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2021 and it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, any phase out of LIBOR or any establishment of any successor benchmark rates on our new credit facility or our business generally. As a result, our interest costs could increase and our access to capital could change, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. We may require additional capital to support our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business and may require additional funds. In particular, we may seek additional funds to develop new features and enhance our existing features, expand our operations, including our sales and marketing organizations and our presence outside of the United States, expand office space including into new facilities, improve our infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, technologies, services, features and other assets. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing that we may secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth, scale our infrastructure, develop feature enhancements and respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected. Risks Related to Information Technology, Intellectual Property, and Data Security A security breach, network attack or information security incident could delay or interrupt service to our customers, result in the unauthorized access to, or use, modification or publishing of customer content or other information, harm our reputation or subject us to significant liability. We are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems. Any such attack, or any information security incident from any other source affecting us or our services providers, including through employee error or misconduct or additional vulnerabilities introduced by remote work arrangements, could lead to interruptions, delays, website or application shutdowns, loss of data or unauthorized access to, or use or acquisition of, personal information, confidential information or other data that we or our services providers process or maintain. For example, in December 2015, we suffered a denial-of-service attack, which resulted in the inability for some of our customers to access our platform for several hours. If we experience additional compromises to our security that result in performance or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our platform or the loss of, or unauthorized access to, personal information or other types of confidential information, our customers or application providers may assert claims against us for credits, refunds or other damages, and may lose trust and confidence in our platform. Additionally, security breaches or other unauthorized access to, or use or acquisition of, personal information or other types of confidential information that we or our services providers maintain, could result in claims against us for identity theft or other similar fraud claims, breach of contract or indemnity, governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and partners to lose trust in us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. Our existing insurance coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims related to a security breach. An insurer may also deny coverage as to a future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also be required to incur significant costs for remediation or expend significant capital and other resources to address a security breach. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated countries, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, customers' and application providers' accounts and listing pages hosted on our platform could be accessed by unauthorized persons for the purpose of placing illegal, abusive or otherwise unauthorized content on their respective websites and applications. If an unauthorized person obtained access to a customer's account or our platform, such person could update the customer's business information with abusive content or create and disseminate false responses to reviews. This type of unauthorized activity could negatively affect our ability to attract new customers and application providers, deter current customers and application providers from using our platform, subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines, indemnification requests or additional liability under customer contracts, or other action or liability, any of which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and harm our business and operating results. Patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in our industry. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. In addition, because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time, there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our features. Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. If asserted, we cannot assure you that an infringement claim will be successfully defended. Certain third parties have substantially greater resources than we have and may be able to sustain the costs of intellectual property litigation for longer periods of time than we can. A successful claim against us could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our platform, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify applications or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We could incur substantial costs in protecting or defending our intellectual property rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary methods and technologies. There can be no assurance that the particular forms of intellectual property protection that we seek, including business decisions about when to file trademark applications and patent applications, will be adequate to protect our business. We intend to continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. However, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property, that the scope of the claims in our issued patents will be sufficient or have the coverage originally sought, that our issued patents will provide us with any competitive advantages, or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties or found by a judicial authority to be invalid or unenforceable. We could be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights or those of others, or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation may fail, and even if successful, could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in a diversion of significant resources. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or alleging that we infringe the counterclaimant's own intellectual property. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related pending patent applications at risk of not being issued. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. During the course of litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Any of our patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights could be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of our products or design around our patents. We also rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, customers and others in our efforts to protect our proprietary technology, processes and methods. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information, and it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy our software or other proprietary technology or information, or to develop similar software independently without our having an adequate remedy for unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information, and in these cases, we would not be able to assert any trade secret rights against those parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property and other proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying, transfer and use of our proprietary technology or information may increase. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property. We cannot be certain that our means of protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology. If we fail to meaningfully protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our platform utilizes open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business. Our platform utilizes software governed by open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our platform. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a specified manner. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, or to re-engineer all or a portion of software, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our platform. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business. We employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our platform, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which could adversely affect our business. Our platform incorporates certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies, including companies that sell products that compete with our platform. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software and development tools in the future. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew licenses for third-party software that we use. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, this may not always be the case, or the software we currently license may be difficult or costly to replace. In addition, integration of the software used in our platform with new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources. Also, to the extent that our platform depends upon the successful operation of third-party software in conjunction with our software, any undetected errors or defects in this third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our platform, delay new feature introductions, result in a failure of our platform and injure our reputation. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties. The reliability of our network and support infrastructure will be critical to our success. Sustained failures or outages could lead to significant costs and service disruptions, which could negatively affect our business, financial results and reputation. Our reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our customers and application providers are dependent upon the reliable performance of our platform and our underlying technical and network infrastructure. Our customers access our platform through our website and related technologies. We rely on internal systems and third-party service providers, including data center, cloud computing, bandwidth and telecommunications equipment providers, to maintain the availability of our platform. If any service provider fails to provide sufficient capacity to support our platform, experiences service outages, reduces or suspends service due to a natural disaster or pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise ceases to do business, such failure could interrupt our customers' access to our services. For example, we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing providers located in the United States, Germany and Japan. Our primary data center is in New Jersey, and our backup data center is in Texas. If these data centers or cloud computing services become unavailable to us without sufficient advance notice, if we are unable to renew our agreements with these providers or if a provider is acquired or ceases business, we would likely experience delays in delivering our platform until we could migrate to an alternate provider. Our disaster recovery program contemplates transitioning our platform to our backup center in the event of a catastrophe and our platform may be unavailable, in whole or in part, during any transition procedure. We have experienced, and will in the future experience, interruptions, outages and other performance problems. Such disruptions may be due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of customers and partners accessing our platform simultaneously and inadequate design. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure requirements, our existing customers may experience performance degradation or service outages, which may subject us to financial penalties, financial liabilities and customer losses. For example, to support the international growth of our business, we have expanded and may need to continue to expand capacity outside the United States, but we may not be able to address future capacity constraints, either through existing or alternative providers, in a cost-effective and timely manner, if at all. When we add capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers\u2019 data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our software, or in the software or systems of our third-party application providers and partners, could materially and adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects. Our features are highly technical and complex. Our software has previously contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software may only be discovered after the software has been deployed. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our software after it has been deployed could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customers, partners or application providers, loss of revenue or liability for damages. In addition, the proper functioning of our platform is dependent on the ability of our Knowledge Network application providers and partners to maintain the availability and proper functioning of their software integrations with our systems and also is dependent on the ability of our third-party application providers to maintain the availability and proper functioning of their websites and applications on which business listing information is published for customers. For example, a number of our Knowledge Network application providers provide us with an Application Program Interface, or API, on which our ability to interface with that provider is based. Furthermore, in a rapidly changing business environment, for example in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our Knowledge Network application providers may experience limitations and delays, which could limit the functionality of our platform. If the functionality of the software, APIs or websites of our third-party application providers is impaired, our customers may attribute such limitations to us and our platform thus damaging our reputation and customer relationships. If our Knowledge Network application providers do not maintain the availability and proper functioning of their software, APIs, websites and applications, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially affected. Risks Related to Laws, Regulation and Taxation We are subject to general litigation that may materially adversely affect us. From time to time, we may be involved in disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. We expect that the number and significance of potential disputes may increase as our business expands and our company grows larger. While our agreements with customers limit our liability for damages arising from our platform, we cannot assure you that these contractual provisions will protect us from liability for damages in the event we are sued or a dispute arises. Although we carry general liability insurance coverage, our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation or dispute resolution, require significant amounts of management time, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, including those related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue. We receive, store and process personal information and other data from and about customers, including third-party reseller customers, partners and, in limited instances, end users of our services, in addition to our employees and services providers. Also, in connection with future feature offerings, we may receive, store and process additional types of data, including personally identifiable information, related to end consumers. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and various state, local and foreign agencies. Our data handling also is subject to contractual obligations and industry standards. The U.S. federal and various state governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use, storage and security of data relating to individuals, including the use of contact information and other data for marketing, advertising and other communications with individuals and businesses. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires covered businesses to, among other things, make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use, and sharing practices, and allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. The CCPA also provides a new private cause of action for certain data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which will become effective on January 1, 2023, will significantly modify the CCPA, and also create a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. The effects of the CCPA and the CPRA are potentially significant and may require us to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply and increase our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation. Additionally, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. Similarly, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, have laws and regulations dealing with the handling and processing of personal information obtained from their residents, which in certain cases are more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of various types of data, including data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses and in some jurisdictions, Internet Protocol, or IP, addresses. Within the European Union, legislators have adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in May 2018. The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data than previous EU data protection laws and imposes significant penalties for non- compliance. The United Kingdom has implemented a Data Protection Act that substantially implements the GDPR. However, the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to exit the European Union, known as Brexit, has created uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom in the medium to long term, which may delay or deter transactions with customers that transfer data to and from the United Kingdom. We participate in and have certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks with respect to our transfer of certain personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. In July 2020, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, but concluded that the Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data are valid. The invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and related uncertainty regarding other data transfer mechanisms could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the European Union, while increasing our compliance costs and legal and regulatory risks. Customers and potential customers may view alternative data transfer mechanisms as being too costly, burdensome or uncertain and therefore impairing our ability to attract and retain customers. In addition, other mechanisms that we use or may use in the future in an effort to legitimize cross-border data transfers may be challenged or invalidated or may evolve such that they do not function as appropriate means for us to transfer certain personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. These domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security are evolving, can be subject to significant change and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. Interpretation of certain requirements remains unclear and may evolve, in particular for regulations that have recently been enacted. Application of laws may be inconsistent or may conflict among jurisdictions. In addition, these regulations have increased our compliance costs and may impair our ability to grow our business or offer our service in some locations, may subject us to liability for non-compliance, may require us to modify our data processing and transferring practices and policies and may strain our technical capabilities. In addition as we, our customers and potential customers evaluate the impact of new regulations such as GDPR and as additional requirements pursuant to such regulations are adopted, sales cycles have lengthened and transaction costs have increased as customers conduct additional diligence and contractual obligations under the new regulations are negotiated. We also handle credit card and other personal information. Due to the sensitive nature of such information, we have implemented policies and procedures in an effort to preserve and protect our data and our customers' data against loss, misuse, corruption, misappropriation caused by systems failures, unauthorized access or misuse. Notwithstanding these policies, we could be subject to liability claims by individuals and customers whose data resides in our databases for the misuse of that information. If we fail to meet appropriate compliance levels, this could negatively impact our ability to utilize credit cards as a method of payment, and/or collect and store credit card information, which could disrupt our business. We may be subject to rules of the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and potentially other federal agencies and state laws related to commercial electronic mail and other messages. Compliance with these provisions may limit our ability to send certain types of messages. If we were found to have violated such rules and regulations, we may face enforcement actions by the FTC or FCC or face civil penalties, either of which could adversely affect our business. As our products are applied to new uses and in new verticals, we may become subject to additional regulations or legal risks. For example, we have begun selling our platform to government entities. Risks associated with sales to government entities include adherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific contractual requirements. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results. Sales to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully complete a sale. Our platform has been and increasingly may be used to store confidential or sensitive information, which exposes us to additional risks. For example, in order to offer our products to certain customers in the health care industry we have implemented certain security and privacy measures and related procedures to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. This may require us to execute HIPAA business associate agreements, or BAAs, with certain customers that are \u201ccovered entities\u201d under HIPAA, which would subject us to additional liabilities, penalties and fines in the event we fail to comply with the terms of such agreements. The storage of such information may require us to modify and enhance our platform at a significant cost. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal or contractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security, may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and partners to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, marketing, consumer communications, information security and local data residency in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations or any changed interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to develop and market new features and maintain and grow our customer base and increase revenue. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of data or additional requirements placed upon us, our customers, partners or end consumers in connection with the use and disclosure of such information could require us to incur additional costs or modify our platform or other aspects of our products and services, possibly in a material manner, and could increase the complexity and cost of developing and deploying new products or limit our ability to develop new products and features altogether. If our policies, procedures, or measures relating to privacy, data protection, marketing, or customer communications fail or are perceived to fail to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal obligations or industry standards, we may be subject to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, regulatory investigations, fines, penalties and negative publicity and could cause our application providers, customers and partners to lose trust in us, which could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, our third-party reseller customers, over which we have more limited control, may not comply with the laws, regulations and policies described above, which may damage our reputation or subject us to costly legal or regulatory inquiries and liability. We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation. We are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery and similar laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and possibly other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years, are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making, offering, soliciting or accepting improper payments or other benefits to or from government officials and others in the private sector. As we increase our international sales and business, particularly in countries with a low score on the Corruptions Perceptions Index by Transparency International, and increase our use of third-party business partners such as sales agents, distributors, resellers, or consultants, our risks under these laws may increase. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, business partners, resellers and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize, control or have actual knowledge of such activities. While we have policies and procedures in this area, we cannot guarantee that improprieties committed by our employees or third parties will not occur. Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, whistleblower complaints, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management's attention and resources and significant defense and compliance costs and other professional fees and may harm our reputation, which may damage our relationships with our customers, strategic partners and other third parties. In certain cases, enforcement authorities may even require us to appoint an independent compliance monitor, which can result in added costs and administrative burdens. Any investigations, actions or sanctions or other previously mentioned harm could have a material negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. Our business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export and import controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, including U.S. customs regulations, the U.S. Commerce Department's Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities and also require authorization for the export of certain encryption items. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our services or could limit our customers' ability to implement our services in those countries. Although we take precautions to prevent our platform from being provided in violation of such laws, our platform may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges, monetary penalties, and, in extreme cases, imprisonment of responsible employees for knowing and willful violations of these laws. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. In addition, changes in our platform or changes in applicable export or import regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could also result in decreased use of our products or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business. Although we take precautions to prevent transactions with U.S. sanction targets, we could inadvertently provide our platform to persons prohibited by U.S. sanctions. Violations of export and import regulations and economic sanctions could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Changes in laws and regulations related to the internet or changes in internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our platform and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet. Federal, state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium. In addition, government agencies or private organizations have imposed and may impose additional taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the internet, generally. These laws or charges could limit the use of the internet or decrease the demand for internet-based solutions. In addition, the use of the internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease-of-use, accessibility and quality of service. The performance of the internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been adversely affected by \"viruses\", \"worms\" and similar malicious programs. If the use of the internet is reduced as a result of these or other issues, then demand for our platform could decline, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate may impact our financial results. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States, and we continue to expand our operations internationally. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in non-deductible expenses, expiration or non-utilization of net operating losses, changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock options and awards compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes and changes in accounting principles and tax laws in jurisdictions where we operate. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. We may have additional tax liabilities, which could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the (provision for) benefit from income taxes and other tax liabilities. We generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. The amount of taxes we pay may depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. Our tax liabilities may be impacted if our intercompany transactions, which are required to be computed on an arm's-length basis, are challenged and successfully disputed by the tax authorities. In determining the adequacy of income taxes, we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes that could result if our tax positions were challenged by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities. The tax authorities in the United States and other countries where we do business may examine our income and other tax returns. The ultimate outcome of these examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of examinations, we may be required to record charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from tax examinations in federal, state, city or international jurisdictions, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in taxing jurisdictions\u2019 tax laws and administrative interpretations, or changes in accounting principles. Any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our customers, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our business. The application of federal, state, local and international tax laws to services provided electronically is evolving. New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, possibly with retroactive effect, and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the internet. These enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately result in a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows. Existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us, possibly with retroactive effect, which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines or penalties and interest for past amounts. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which has resulted or could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our customers for past amounts, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest, or future requirements may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. As of January 31, 2021, we had significant U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, due to prior period losses. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage-point cumulative change by value in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period, is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset post-change taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code and similar state provisions. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire, decrease in value or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Our Status as a Public Company Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Our quarterly results of operations, including the levels of our revenue, gross margin and profitability, as well as our cash flows and unearned revenue balances, may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results and key metrics may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results and metrics may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and, as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. These fluctuations may negatively affect the value of our common stock. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results include: \u2022our ability to attract new customers; \u2022our ability to execute on our business strategy; \u2022the launch of significant new products and features; \u2022the addition or loss of large customers, including third-party reseller customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations; \u2022the timing of recognition of revenue; \u2022a change in accounting principles; \u2022the timing of billing and cash collections; \u2022the timing of significant marketing events and related expenses; \u2022the amount and timing of operating expenses; \u2022network outages and security breaches; \u2022natural disasters, pandemics including the COVID-19 pandemic, acts of terrorism and other events beyond our control; \u2022general economic, industry and market conditions; \u2022customer renewal rates; \u2022pricing changes upon any renewals of customer agreements; \u2022changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; \u2022the timing and success of new feature introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or application providers; \u2022the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies; and \u2022unforeseen litigation. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they cease publishing research or change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, or if our actual results differ significantly from our guidance or analysts' expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If few analysts commence coverage of us, cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline. In addition, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline. In addition, from time to time, we may release earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements in our earnings releases, earnings conference calls or otherwise regarding our future performance that represent our management's estimates as of the date of release. Some or all of the assumptions of any future guidance that we furnish may not materialize or may vary significantly from actual future results. Furthermore, the adoption of new accounting standards may require us to modify our earnings guidance, and such modifications though solely attributed to changes in accounting standards, may be perceived unfavorably. Any failure to meet guidance or analysts' expectations could have a material adverse effect on the trading price or trading volume of our common stock. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and may decline. Market volatility may affect the value of an investment in our common stock and could subject us to litigation. Technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including: \u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results; \u2022changes in projected operational and financial results; \u2022addition or loss of significant customers; \u2022addition or loss of significant strategic relationships with application providers in the Knowledge Network; \u2022changes in laws or regulations applicable to our platform; \u2022actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors; \u2022announcements of technological innovations or new offerings by us or our competitors; \u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital-raising activities or commitments; \u2022additions or departures of key personnel; \u2022changes in our financial guidance or securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance; \u2022discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities; \u2022reaction to our press releases and filings with the SEC; \u2022changes in accounting principles; \u2022announcements related to litigation, regulation or disputes; \u2022fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; \u2022sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders; \u2022share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares; \u2022natural disasters, pandemics including the COVID-19 pandemic, acts of terrorism and other events beyond our control; and \u2022general economic and market conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, and technology companies in particular. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. If the market price of our common stock declines, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention from other business concerns, which could also harm our business. Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline. We may issue additional securities. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, the ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted, possibly materially. New investors in subsequent transactions could also gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. In addition, substantial blocks of our total outstanding shares are eligible to be sold into the market, although shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act The price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or if there is a large number of shares of our common stock available for sale and the market perceives that sales will occur. We have 123,989,179 shares of our common stock outstanding as of January 31, 2021. In addition, equity compensation comprises a significant component of our compensation strategy. We have granted and expect to grant equity awards from our equity incentive plan and under the terms of such plan, shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance will be subject to annual increases, which would cause dilution. We have and may in the future file registration statements registering the issuance of shares of common stock subject to outstanding options under our equity incentive plans and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. Shares registered on the Form S-8 registration statement would be eligible for sale to the public, subject to certain legal limitations. The market price of the shares of our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares. Additionally, certain existing holders of our common stock, or their transferees, will have rights, subject to specified conditions, to require us to file one or more registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If we were to register the resale of these shares, they could be freely sold in the public market. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We may not declare or pay cash dividends on our capital stock in the near future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock. Our status as a Delaware corporation may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following: \u2022a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our Board of Directors; \u2022a prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of our directors; \u2022the requirement that our directors may only be removed for cause; \u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer; \u2022the right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director; \u2022a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders; \u2022the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board, the chairman of the Board of Directors, our chief executive officer, or our president (in the absence of a chief executive officer), which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; \u2022the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of our voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to affect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and \u2022advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The provisions of Section 203 may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for three years after achieving that ownership threshold. A Delaware corporation may opt out of this provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders. However, we have not opted out of this provision. These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board of Directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significantly increased costs and substantial demands on management time to operate as a public company. As a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Furthermore, on January 31, 2019, we no longer qualified as an emerging growth company, and became subject to additional reporting requirements and standards and accelerated filing deadlines for our periodic reports. For example, we have incurred and continue to incur significant expenses and devoted substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition on January 31, 2019, we were required to adopt certain accounting standards including ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), when certain extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies expired. We also became subject to enhanced disclosures obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation. Compliance with these requirements has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and has made some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel devote substantial time to our public company requirements, which diverts attention from operational and other business matters. We have and will continue to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and maintain an internal audit function. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of operating as a public company or the timing of such costs."}
{"Risk_Category": "Cybersecurity", "Severity": "High", "Evidence": "The company disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities or incidents.", "source_text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Risks Related to the Nature of Our Business Unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global markets, or reductions in information technology spending, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results. Our operating results may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. The US and other key international economies continue to experience events in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic that may result, and have at times in the past experienced cyclical downturns that have resulted, in a significant weakening of the economy, limited availability of credit, a reduction in business confidence and activity, and other difficulties that may affect one or more of the industries to which we sell our services. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, developments such as the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d), evolving trade policies between the US and international trade partners, and conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere have created many economic and political uncertainties which have impacted worldwide markets. These global economic and political conditions may impact our business in a number of ways. The revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depends on demand for enterprise application software generally and for people development solutions in particular. We sell our people development solutions primarily to large, mid-sized, and small business organizations whose businesses fluctuate based on general economic and business conditions. In addition, a portion of our revenue is attributable to the number of users of our products at each of our customers, which in turn is influenced by the employment and hiring patterns of our customers and potential customers. To the extent that economic uncertainty or weak economic conditions, whether in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, cause our customers and potential customers to freeze or reduce their headcount, demand for our products may be negatively affected. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced lengthening of sales cycles, delayed payments, and requests for extensions of payment terms from certain customers. Additionally, economic downturns have historically resulted in overall reductions in spending on information technology and people development solutions as well as pressure from customers and potential customers for extended billing terms. If economic, political, or market conditions deteriorate, or if there is uncertainty around these conditions, our customers and potential customers may elect to decrease their information technology and people development budgets by deferring or reconsidering product purchases, which would limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results. Our business depends substantially on the level of our customer satisfaction and specifically on customers renewing their agreements with us, purchasing additional products from us, or adding additional users. Any significant decline in our customer satisfaction rates, customer renewal rates, or the rates at which our customers purchase additional products or add additional users would harm our future operating results. In order for us to improve our operating results, it is important that our customer satisfaction remains high, that our customers renew their agreements with us when the initial contract term expires, and that they also purchase additional products or add additional users. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the initial subscription period, and there is no assurance that our customers will renew their subscriptions at the same or a higher level of service, if at all. Every year, some of our customers elect not to renew their agreements with us. Moreover, certain of our customers have the right to cancel their agreements for convenience, subject to certain notice requirements and, in some cases, early termination fees. Our customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our products, our customer service, our pricing, the prices of competing products or services, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base and/or the acquired customer base, reduced hiring by our customers, or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms, fail to purchase additional products, or fail to add new users, our revenue may decline and our operating results may be harmed. The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The market for people development solutions is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented. Many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, much longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do. Further, if one or more of our competitors were to merge, acquire or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our business. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic distributors, systems integrators, HR outsourcers, payroll services companies, third-party consulting firms, or other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to promote our products and limiting the number of consultants available to implement our products. In addition, with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Any of these events could disrupt our operations, reduce our revenue, or harm our business generally. We face competition from desktop software tools and custom-built software that is designed to support the needs of a single organization, as well as from third-party talent and human resource application providers. These software vendors include, without limitation, iCIMS, Oracle Corporation (Taleo), SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors), SkillSoft Limited (SumTotal), Talentsoft SA, Docebo, LinkedIn Learning, and Workday, Inc. In addition, some of the parties with which we maintain business alliances offer, or may offer, products or services that compete with our products or services. Many of our competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products and services. In addition, many of our competitors have established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators, and distributors. Moreover, many software vendors can bundle human resource products or offer such products at a lower price as part of a larger product sale. In addition, some competitors may offer software that addresses one or a limited number of people development functions at a lower price point or with greater depth than our products. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements, and they may also be better able to respond to operational disruptions (such as in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic) than we are. Further, some potential customers, particularly large enterprises, may elect to develop their own internal products. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Because of how we recognize revenue, a significant downturn in our business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. Generally, we recognize revenue from subscription agreements ratably over the terms of these agreements, which is typically three years for our people development solutions. As a result, a significant portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is generated from customer agreements entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decline in new subscriptions in any one quarter may not significantly impact our revenue and financial performance in that quarter, but will negatively affect our revenue, or rate of revenue growth, and financial performance in future quarters. In addition, if subscription agreements expire and are not renewed in the same quarter, our revenue and financial performance in that quarter and subsequent quarters will be negatively affected. However, the revenue impact may not be immediately reflected in our operating results to the extent there is an offsetting increase in revenue from services contracts performed in that same quarter. Finally, we may be unable to adjust our fixed costs in response to reduced revenue. Accordingly, the effect of significant declines in sales and market acceptance of our products may not be reflected in our short-term operating results. Defects in our solutions could affect our reputation, result in significant costs to us, and impair our ability to sell our products and related services. Defects in our solutions could adversely affect our reputation, result in significant costs to us, and impair our ability to sell our products in the future. The costs incurred in correcting any product defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results. Although we continually test our products for defects and work with customers through our customer support organization to identify and correct errors, defects in our products are likely to occur in the future. Any defects that cause interruptions to the availability of our products could result in: \u2022lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products; \u2022early termination of customer agreements or loss of customers; \u2022credits or refunds to customers; \u2022product liability suits against us; \u2022diversion of development resources; \u2022injury to our reputation; and \u2022increased maintenance and warranty costs. While our customer agreements typically contain limitations and disclaimers that purport to limit our liability for damages related to defects in our products, such limitations and disclaimers may not be enforced by a court or other tribunal or otherwise effectively protect us from such claims. Evolving regulation of the Internet, changes in the infrastructure underlying the Internet, or interruptions in Internet access may adversely affect our financial condition by increasing our expenditures and causing customer dissatisfaction. As Internet commerce continues to evolve, regulation by federal, state, or foreign agencies may increase. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because the Internet is a critical component of our business model. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges for accessing the Internet may be imposed by government agencies or private organizations. Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, or impact the way that Internet service providers treat Internet traffic, including laws impacting net neutrality and laws requiring local storage of certain types of data in foreign jurisdictions, may negatively increase our operating costs or otherwise impact our business. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchanged over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business. In addition, the rapid and continual growth of traffic on the Internet has resulted at times in slow connection and download speeds among Internet users. Our business expansion may be harmed if the Internet infrastructure cannot handle our customers\u2019 demands or if hosting capacity becomes insufficient. If our customers become frustrated with the speed at which they can utilize our products over the Internet, our customers may discontinue the use of our people development solutions and choose not to renew their contracts with us. Further, the performance of the Internet has also been adversely affected by viruses, worms, hacking, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, and other similar malicious programs, as well as other forms of damage to portions of its infrastructure, which have resulted in a variety of Internet outages, interruptions, and other delays. These service interruptions could diminish the overall attractiveness of our products to existing and potential users and could cause demand for our products to suffer. If for any reason we are not able to develop enhancements and new features, keep pace with technological developments, or respond to future disruptive technologies, our business will be harmed. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate. To attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers, we will need to enhance and improve our existing products and introduce new features. The success of any enhancement or new feature depends on several factors, including timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance. If we are unable to enhance our existing products to meet customer needs or successfully develop or acquire new features or products, or if such new features or products fail to be successful, our business and operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, because our products are designed to operate on a variety of network, hardware, and software platforms using Internet tools and protocols, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser, and database technologies. If we are unable to respond in a timely and cost-effective manner to these rapid technological developments, our products may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete, and our operating results may be negatively impacted. Finally, our ability to grow is subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver a people development solutions at lower prices, more efficiently, or more conveniently, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete. Certain of our operating results and financial metrics are difficult to predict as a result of seasonality. We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our products. We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, and renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year. Within a given quarter, often a significant portion of our agreements are signed during the last two months of the quarter. This seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenue, due to the fact that we generally recognize subscription revenue over the term of the customer agreement, which is generally three years. We expect this seasonality to continue, which may cause fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics, and thus difficulties in predictability. Even if demand for people development products and services increases generally, there is no guarantee that demand for SaaS products like ours will increase to a corresponding degree. The widespread adoption of our products depends not only on strong demand for people development products and services generally, but also for products and services delivered via a SaaS business model in particular. There are still a significant number of organizations that have adopted no people development functions at all. It is unclear whether such organizations will ever adopt such functions and, if they do, whether they will desire a SaaS people development solution like ours. As a result, we cannot guarantee that our SaaS people development solutions will achieve and sustain the high level of market acceptance that is critical for the success of our business. Integrated, comprehensive SaaS products such as ours represent a relatively recent approach to addressing organizations\u2019 people development challenges, and we may be forced to change the prices and billing terms for our products, or our pricing model generally, as the market for these types of products evolves. Providing organizations with applications to address their people development challenges through integrated, comprehensive SaaS products is a developing market that is still evolving. Some of our current competitors offer their products or services at a lower price or on different billing terms, which has resulted in pressures on our pricing and billing terms. Additionally, competitive dynamics may cause pricing levels, as well as billing terms and pricing models generally, to change further as the market matures and as existing and new market participants introduce new types of products and different approaches to enable organizations to address their people development needs. As a result, we may be forced to reduce the prices we charge for our products or the pricing model on which they are based, and may be unable to renew existing customer agreements or enter into new customer agreements at the same prices and upon the same terms that we have historically. If we are unable to maintain our pricing levels, billing terms, or pricing model, our operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, pricing pressures, increased competition, and macroeconomic factors and events generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business. If we fail to develop our brand, our business may suffer. We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the Cornerstone OnDemand brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and is an important element in attracting new customers. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. In addition, the Cornerstone OnDemand Foundation shares our company name and any negative perceptions of any kind about the Foundation could adversely affect our brand and reputation. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer. Our sales to government entities are subject to a number of additional challenges and risks. We sell to US federal and state and foreign governmental agency customers, and we may increase sales to government entities in the future. The additional risks and challenges associated with doing business with governmental entities include, but are not limited to, the following: \u2022Selling to governmental entities can be more competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than selling to private entities, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale; \u2022Government certification requirements may change, or we may lose one or more government certifications, such as the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certificates; \u2022Governmental entities may have significant leverage in negotiations, thereby enabling such entities to demand contract terms that differ from what we generally agree to in our standard agreements, including, for example, most favored nation clauses and terms allowing contract termination for convenience; \u2022Government demand and payment for our products may be influenced by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, having an adverse impact on public sector demand for our products; and \u2022Government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations, which we have limited experience with, potentially resulting in termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspensions or debarment from future government business. To the extent that we become more reliant on contracts with government entities in the future, our exposure to such risks and challenges could increase, which, in turn, could adversely impact our business. Risks Related to COVID-19 Our operations and employees face risks related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. The COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our operations, including at our headquarters and/or anywhere else we operate, and the business or operations of our customers, suppliers, partners, or other third parties with whom we conduct business. Our business has been and we expect will continue to be adversely impacted by the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has and could continue to cause disruption in the operations of our customers and the suppliers, partners, and other third-parties upon whom we rely. Our headquarters and many of our employees are located in Los Angeles County, California, which has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Officials in Los Angeles County and elsewhere have issued multiple orders to implement various precautions intended to slow the spread of COVID-19, including prohibitions on large gatherings and directives related to social distancing and closure of non-essential or non-critical business at physical locations. Authorities in many other states and cities where our customers, suppliers, and partners are located have issued orders with similar goals and restrictions. While some of these restrictions have been lifted or relaxed in certain areas, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present serious health risks and there is no guarantee when or if all such restrictions will be eliminated, such that we and our customers, suppliers, and partners will be able to safely resume operations consistent with our pre-COVID-19 operations. In response to the serious risk posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and to comply with applicable governmental orders, we have substantially closed our headquarters in Santa Monica, California, along with our other domestic and international offices, asked all of our employees to work from home, and cancelled non-essential business-related travel. These and other operational changes we have implemented may negatively impact productivity and disrupt our business. Additionally, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our suppliers and partners may be unable fulfill their obligations to us in a timely manner or at all. Further, to the extent our customers\u2019 operations have been and continue to be negatively impacted, they may delay payments to us, request payment or other concessions, elect not to renew their agreements with us in a timely manner or at all, or reduce their spending level on our products and services. While we have not had a material impact to date in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to experience lengthening of sales cycles, reduced renewal rates and customer spending (which had an impact on our net annual dollar retention rate in 2020), delayed payments, and requests for extensions of payment terms from certain customers. The COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on our revenue in the near term. The extent of the effect of COVID-19, or any future health crisis, on our operational and financial performance, and on our relationships with suppliers, partners, and customers, will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, the effect of approved vaccines, and the speed and extent to which they are distributed and taken, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. As a result, it is not currently possible to ascertain the overall impact of COVID-19 on our business. If the pandemic continues to persist as a severe worldwide health crisis, the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Risks Related to Acquisitions Failure to integrate our business and operations successfully with those of Saba in the expected time-frame or otherwise may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We do not have a substantial history of acquiring other large companies and have never completed an acquisition of the size and complexity of Saba. The success of our acquisition of Saba will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to integrate Saba's business and operations successfully with ours and to realize fully the anticipated benefits and potential synergies from combining our companies, including, among others: cost savings from eliminating duplicative functions; operational efficiencies in research and development investments; and revenue growth resulting from the addition of Saba\u2019s product portfolio into our pre-acquisition product portfolio and \u201ccross-selling\u201d additional products to Saba customers. If we are unable to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and potential synergies from the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Any failure to timely realize these anticipated benefits could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We completed our acquisition of Saba in April 2020 and are still actively engaged in the integration process. In connection with the integration process, we could experience the loss of key employees, loss of key customers, decreases in revenues, and increases in operating costs, as well as the disruption of our ongoing businesses, any or all of which could limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and potential synergies from the acquisition and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. The additional scale of the combined company's operations, together with the complexity of the integration effort, including integration of critical information technology systems, as well as combining other financial, human resources, and administrative processes, may adversely affect our ability to report financial results on a timely basis. The acquisition may necessitate significant modifications to our internal control systems, processes, and information systems, both during the transition and over the longer-term as we fully integrate the combined company, particularly in light of the fact that Saba (as a private company) was not previously required to report on its internal control over financial reporting. Due to the complexity of the acquisition, we cannot be certain that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective for any period, or on an ongoing basis, nor can we be certain that changes to our internal controls or the design and implementation of new internal controls will not be required. If we are unable to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner or are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the market perception thereof, may be materially adversely affected. As we have in the past, we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, or otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. As we have in the past, we may seek to acquire or invest in other businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our existing solutions, enhance our technical capabilities, lead to cost synergies, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. Most recently, in April 2020, we acquired Saba, a provider of talent experience solutions, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.310 billion, consisting of $1.277 billion in cash consideration (net of cash acquired) and 1,110,352 shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $32.9 million. The pursuit of other potential acquisitions, along with the work required to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire, may divert the attention of management, result in additional dilution, and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are ultimately consummated. When acquiring other businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate the personnel, operations, and technologies of any businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We may also not achieve the anticipated benefits from other acquired businesses due to a number of factors, including: \u2022unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition; \u2022incurrence of acquisition-related and integration expenses or tax impacts, some or all of which might be unanticipated; \u2022ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures, or policies at the acquired company; \u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; \u2022failure to realize synergies in a timely fashion or at all; \u2022harm to our existing relationships with customers, distributors, and partners, including as a result of competing in the markets in which such parties operate; \u2022inability to maintain relationships with key customers, distributors, and partners of the acquired business; \u2022the potential loss of key employees and customers; \u2022potential unknown liabilities or risks associated with the acquired businesses, including those arising from existing contractual obligations or litigation matters; \u2022exposure to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes; \u2022the use of resources that might be used in other parts of our business; and \u2022the use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition. In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill or intangible assets which must be assessed for impairment at least annually or upon certain triggering events. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our operating results. Other future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. For example, as noted above, in connection with the acquisition of Saba, we issued 1,110,352 shares of our common stock and incurred approximately $1.0047 billion of indebtedness. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business, and financial condition may suffer. Risks Related to Information Technology Upon Which We Rely Our systems collect, access, use, and store personal and other customer proprietary information. As a result, we are subject to security risks and are required to invest significant resources to prevent, mitigate, or correct issues arising from potential or actual security breaches. If a security breach occurs, our reputation could be harmed, our business may suffer, and we could incur significant liability. Our people development solutions involve the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 sensitive, proprietary, and confidential information, including personal information, over the Internet (including public networks). Our security measures may be breached as a result of efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states. Our security measures could also be compromised by employee error or malfeasance, which could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to, or denying authorized access to our IT systems, our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords, or other information to gain access to our customers\u2019 data, our data, or our IT systems. A security breach or other security incident of our IT systems, customer data, website, data or app, or those of one of our vendors, partners or other third parties, has occurred in the past, and may occur in the future. For example, in January 2021, an unauthorized party gained access to a separate, legacy application of ours and gained access to the names, email addresses, and training records of approximately three dozen customers. We took appropriate steps to respond to this incident and implemented remedial actions designed to protect against similar issues in the future. Such breaches and other incidents can result in a risk of unauthorized, unlawful, or inappropriate access to, denial of access to, disclosure of, or loss of our customers\u2019 or our sensitive, proprietary, and confidential information, as well as damage to our IT systems and our ability to make required reporting and disclosures as a public company. An actual or perceived security breach or similar incident could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition due to loss of confidence in the security of our products, or result in damage to our reputation, early termination of contracts, decline in sales, disruption to our operations, litigation, regulatory investigations and penalties, or other liabilities. In particular, federal, state, and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws requiring companies and their service providers to maintain certain security measures or to report data breaches to government authorities or affected individuals. In turn, customers\u2019 expectations for the security measures we implement have increased. If we experience security breaches that could have been prevented by measures required by these laws or our customer contracts, or fail to report security breaches within timeframes mandated by law or our customer contracts, we could face significant liability. Techniques to compromise IT systems have become more complex over time and are often not identified until they are exploited. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent such techniques. Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on a broad range of products, components, and third-party services, and a vulnerability in any of them can expose us to a security breach. In addition, our customers and their third-party service providers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored in our solutions, and because we do not control our customers or their service providers, we cannot prevent vulnerabilities in their security measures from being exploited. Our efforts to detect, prevent, and remediate known or potential security vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party hardware or software, may result in additional direct and indirect costs. Finally, if a high-profile security breach occurs with respect to another SaaS provider, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in the security of the SaaS business model generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones. We rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or could cause errors or failures of our service. In addition to the software we develop, we rely on computer hardware, purchased or leased, and software licensed from third parties in order to deliver our solutions. This hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in our ability to provide our solutions until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available, identified, obtained, and integrated. In addition, errors or defects in third-party hardware or software used in our solutions could result in errors or a failure of our products, which could harm our business. If we fail to manage our SaaS hosting network infrastructure capacity, our existing customers may experience service outages and our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our people development solutions. We have experienced significant growth in the number of users, transactions, and data that our hosting infrastructure supports. We seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our SaaS hosting network infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers. We also seek to maintain excess capacity to facilitate the rapid provision of new customer deployments and the expansion of existing customer deployments. However, the provision of new hosting infrastructure requires significant lead time. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, our existing customers may experience service outages that may subject us to financial penalties, financial liabilities, and customer losses. If our hosting infrastructure capacity fails to keep pace with increased sales, customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenue growth. Any significant disruption in our SaaS hosting network infrastructure could harm our reputation, require us to provide credits or refunds, result in early terminations of customer agreements or a loss of customers, and adversely affect our business. Our SaaS hosting network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations. Our customers access our people development solutions through a standard web browser and depend on us for fast and reliable access to our products. Our software is proprietary, and we currently rely on four third-party data center hosting facilities, which we lease, and the expertise of members of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our solutions. We are in the process of migrating our solutions from our leased data center hosting facilities to public cloud third-party data center providers. After we complete this migration, we will rely extensively on these public cloud providers to provide our customers and their users with fast and reliable access to our products. Any disruption of or interference with our SaaS hosting network infrastructure, including the services and operations of the public cloud providers, could harm our reputation, business, and results of operations. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions in our computing and communications infrastructure. Factors that may cause such disruptions that may harm our reputation include: \u2022human error; \u2022security breaches; \u2022telecommunications outages from third-party providers; \u2022computer viruses; \u2022acts of terrorism, sabotage, or other intentional acts of vandalism, including cyber attacks; \u2022unforeseen interruption or damages experienced in moving hardware to a new location; \u2022fire, earthquake, flood, and other natural disasters; and \u2022power loss. Although we generally back-up our customer databases hourly, store our data in more than one geographically distinct location at least weekly, and perform real-time mirroring of data to disaster recovery locations, we do not currently offer immediate access to disaster recovery locations in the event of a disaster or major outage. Thus, in the event of any of the factors described above, or certain other failures of our computing infrastructure, customers may not be able to access their data for 24 hours or more and there is a remote chance that customer data from recent transactions may be permanently lost or otherwise compromised. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption. Moreover, some of our agreements include performance guarantees and service level standards that obligate us to provide credits, refunds or termination rights in the event of a significant disruption in our SaaS hosting network infrastructure or other technical problems that relate to the functionality or design of our solutions. Risks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties Our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties. We anticipate that we will continue to depend on various third-party relationships in order to grow our business. In addition to growing our indirect sales channels, we intend to pursue additional relationships with other third parties, such as technology and content providers and implementation consultants. Identifying, negotiating, and documenting relationships with third parties requires significant time and resources, as does integrating third-party content and technology. Our agreements with distributors and providers of technology, content, and consulting services are typically non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our products. In addition, these distributors and providers may not perform as expected under our agreements, and we have had and may in the future have, disagreements or disputes with such distributors and providers, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation. A global economic slowdown could also adversely affect the businesses of our distributors and it is possible that they may not be able to devote the resources we expect to our relationships with such distributors. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot guarantee that these relationships will result in improved operating results. We rely significantly on implementation partners to deliver professional services to our customers, and if these implementation partners fail to deliver these professional services effectively, or if we are unable to incentivize new partners to service our customers, our operating results will be harmed. We rely significantly on various partners to assist us in the successful implementation of our products and to optimize our customers\u2019 use of our products during the terms of their engagements. We provide our implementation partners with specific training and programs to assist them in servicing our customers, but there can be no assurance that these steps will be utilized or effective. If these partners fail to deliver these services to our customers in an effective and timely manner, we may suffer reputational harm and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. We also may not be able to incentivize new partners to service our customers. If we are unable to maintain our existing relationships or enter into new ones, we would have to devote substantially more resources to delivering our professional services. If we fail to effectively manage our implementation partners, our ability to sell our products and subscriptions and our operating results will be harmed. Failure to effectively manage customer deployments by our third-party service providers could adversely impact our business. In cases where our third-party service providers are engaged either by us or by a customer directly to deploy a product for a customer, our third-party service providers need to have a substantial understanding of such customer\u2019s business so they can configure the product in a manner that complements its existing business processes and integrates the product into its existing systems. It may be difficult for us to manage the timeliness of these deployments and the allocation of personnel and resources by our customers. Failure to successfully manage customer deployments by us or our third-party service providers could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing customers, face potential customer disputes, or limit the rate at which new customers purchase our products. Risks Related to Our Financial Results and Need for Additional Capital Our financial results may fluctuate due to our long, variable and, therefore, unpredictable sales cycle and our focus on large and mid-market organizations. We plan our expenses based on certain assumptions about the length and variability of our sales cycle. If our sales cycle becomes longer or more variable, our results may be adversely affected. Our sales cycle generally varies in duration from two to nine months and, in some cases, much longer depending on the size of the potential customer. Factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include among others: \u2022the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our products; \u2022the relatively long duration of the commitment customers make in their agreements with us; \u2022the discretionary nature of potential customers\u2019 purchasing and budget cycles and decisions; \u2022the competitive nature of potential customers\u2019 evaluation and purchasing processes; \u2022the lengthy purchasing approval processes of potential customers; \u2022the evolving functionality demands of potential customers; \u2022fluctuations in the people development needs of potential customers; \u2022announcements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors; and \u2022macroeconomic factors, such as the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. The fluctuations that result from the length and variability of our sales cycle may be magnified by our focus on sales to large and mid-sized organizations. If we are unable to close an expected significant transaction with one or more of these companies in a particular period, or if an expected transaction is delayed until a subsequent period, our operating results for that period, and for any future periods in which revenue from such transaction would otherwise have been recognized, may be adversely affected. Servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including our Convertible Notes due March 17, 2023 with an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million, and the Term Loan Facility due April 22, 2027 with an aggregate principal amount of $1.0047 billion, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Term Loan Facility, the Convertible Notes, or any future indebtedness we may incur; or to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Convertible Notes, the Term Loan Facility, or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on the Convertible Notes, the Term Loan Facility, or future indebtedness. Further, with certain exceptions, upon a change of control the holders of our Convertible Notes may require that we repurchase all or part of such notes at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus the total sum of all remaining scheduled interest payments through the remainder of the term of such notes. In such event we may not have enough cash available or be able to obtain financing to repurchase the Convertible Notes, and our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or agreements governing our other indebtedness. We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may seek additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features or enhance our existing products, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. For example, we incurred $1.0047 billion of additional indebtedness and issued 1,110,352 shares of our common stock to finance the acquisition of Saba, which was completed in April 2020. If we raise additional funds through issuances of equity or debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired. Further, the indenture governing the Convertible Notes and the Term Loan Facility includes restrictive covenants that, subject to specified exceptions and parameters, limit our ability to incur additional debt, and the Term Loan Facility includes additional restrictive covenants that limit, subject to specific exceptions and parameters, our ability to make investments or acquisitions, declare dividends, or take certain other corporate actions. As a result, we may be unable to take advantage of strategic or business development opportunities as they arise, or we may not be able to react to market conditions, if we are restricted in our ability to raise debt financing, or we may be required to seek alternative means to generate cash, including by selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive, if available at all. Our financial results may fluctuate due to various business factors, some of which may be beyond our control. There are a number of other factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from period to period, including among others: \u2022changes in billing terms and collection cycles in customer agreements; \u2022the extent to which new customers are attracted to our products to satisfy their people development needs; \u2022the timing and rate at which we sign agreements with new customers; \u2022our access to service providers and partners when we outsource customer service projects; \u2022our ability to manage the quality and completion of the customer implementations performed by partners; \u2022the timing and duration of our customer implementations, which is often outside of our direct control; \u2022our ability to provide, or partner with effective partners to provide, resources for customer implementations and consulting projects; \u2022the extent to which we retain existing customers and satisfy their requirements; \u2022the extent to which existing customers renew their subscriptions to our products and the timing of those renewals; \u2022the extent to which existing customers purchase or discontinue the use of additional products and add or decrease the number of users; \u2022the extent to which our customers request enhancements to underlying features and functionality of our products, and the timing of our delivery of these enhancements to our customers; \u2022the addition or loss of large customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations; \u2022the number and size of new customers, as well as the number and size of renewal customers in a particular period; \u2022the mix of customers among large, mid-sized, and small organizations; \u2022changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; \u2022seasonal factors affecting demand for our products or potential customers\u2019 purchasing decisions; \u2022the financial condition and creditworthiness of our customers; \u2022the amount and timing of our operating expenses, including those related to the maintenance, expansion, and restructuring of our business, operations, and infrastructure; \u2022changes in the operational efficiency of our business; \u2022the timing and success of synergy realization resulting from integration of acquired companies, such as Saba; \u2022the timing and success of our new product and service introductions; \u2022the timing of expenses of the development of new products and technologies, including enhancements to our products; \u2022our ability to aggregate large data sets into meaningful insights to drive increased demand for our products; \u2022continued strong demand for people development in the US and globally; \u2022the success of current and new competitive products and services by our competitors; \u2022other changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers, or strategic partners; \u2022our ability to manage our existing business and future growth, including in terms of additional headcount, additional customers, incremental users, and new geographic regions; \u2022expenses related to our network and data centers, and the expansion of such networks and data centers; \u2022the effects of, and expenses associated with, acquisitions of third-party technologies or businesses and any potential future charges for impairment of goodwill resulting from those acquisitions; \u2022equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding Convertible Notes; \u2022business disruptions, costs, and events related to shareholder activism; \u2022legal or political changes in local or foreign jurisdictions that decrease demand for, or restrict our ability to sell or provide, our products; \u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including any fluctuation caused by uncertainties relating to UK\u2019s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit; \u2022general economic, industry, and market conditions, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic; and \u2022various factors related to disruptions in our SaaS hosting network infrastructure, defects in our products, privacy and data security considerations, and exchange rate fluctuations, each of which is described elsewhere in these risk factors. In light of the foregoing factors, we believe that our financial results, including our revenue, operating income, and free cash flows may vary significantly from period-to-period. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. Because we generally recognize subscription revenue from our customers over the terms of their agreements but incur most costs associated with generating such agreements upfront, rapid growth in our customer base may put downward pressure on our operating margin in the short term. The expenses associated with generating customer agreements are generally incurred up front but the resulting subscription revenue is generally recognized over the life of the agreements; therefore, increased growth in the number of our customers will result in our recognition of more costs than revenue during the early periods covered by such agreements, even in cases where the agreements are expected to be profitable for us over their full terms. We have a history of losses, and we cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability. We have a history of losses. We experienced net losses of $40.0 million, $4.1 million, and $33.8 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit was $564.7 million and total stockholders\u2019 equity was $268.9 million. It is possible that we may continue to incur operating losses in the future as a result of expenses associated with the continued development and expansion of our business as well as borrowing costs on our substantial indebtedness. Our expenses include among others, sales and marketing, research and development, consulting and support services, costs related to our acquisitions and the integration of businesses we acquire, and other costs related to the development, marketing, and sale and service of our products that may not generate revenue until later periods, if at all. Any failure to increase revenue or manage our cost structure as we implement initiatives to grow our business could prevent us from sustaining profitability. In addition, our ability to achieve sustained profitability is subject to a number of the risks and uncertainties discussed below, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Risks Related to Compliance with Laws Existing or future laws and regulations relating to privacy or data security could increase the cost of our products, limit their use and adoption, and subject us or our customers to litigation, regulatory investigations and penalties, and other potential liabilities. Our people development solutions enable our customers to collect, manage, and store a wide range of data, including personal data, related to every phase of the employee performance and management cycle. The US and various state governments have adopted or proposed laws governing the collection, use, storage, sharing, and processing of personal data. Several foreign jurisdictions, including but not limited to the EU and its member states, the UK, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Australia, and India, have adopted legislation (including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirements governing the personal data of individuals in these jurisdictions. In some cases, these laws impose obligations not only on many of our customers, but also directly on us. These laws and regulations are complex and change frequently, at times due to differing economic conditions and changes in political climate, with new laws and regulations proposed frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to different and conflicting interpretations. These laws have the potential to increase costs of compliance, risks of noncompliance and penalties for noncompliance, and the cost and complexity of selling and delivering our solutions. For example, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which took effect on May 25, 2018, imposes obligations on our customers and directly on us. Among other obligations under the GDPR, we are required to: give more detailed disclosure about how we collect, use, and share personal data; contractually commit to data protection measures in our contracts with customers; maintain adequate data security measures; notify regulators and affected individuals of certain personal data breaches; meet extensive privacy governance and documentation requirements; and honor individuals\u2019 expanded data protection rights, including their rights to access, correct, and delete their personal data. Companies that violate the GDPR can face fines of up to the greater of 20 million euros or 4% of their worldwide annual revenue, and restrictions on data processing. Our customers\u2019 failure to comply with the GDPR could lead to significant fines imposed by regulators or restrictions on our ability to process personal information as needed to provide our services. We may also be obligated to assist our customers with their own compliance obligations under the GDPR. Further, the GDPR and other European data protection laws restrict the transfer of personal information from Europe to the United States and most other countries unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific compliance mechanisms. One of the mechanisms on which we previously relied, the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, was invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union in a July 2020 decision. The decision also called into question whether companies can lawfully use the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses as a compliance mechanism for transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States or most other countries. Authorities in Switzerland also have issued guidance calling the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework inadequate and raising similar questions about the Standard Contractual Clauses. At present, there are few, if any, viable alternatives to the Standard Contractual Clauses, on which we have relied, including for transfers to India, where we maintain a significant support center. If we are unable to implement sufficient safeguards to ensure that our transfers of personal information from Europe are lawful, we will face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing personal information from Europe. We also rely on the European Commission\u2019s recognition of Canada, Israel, and New Zealand, where we maintain significant support centers, as providing an \u201cadequate\u201d level of protection for personal data transferred from Europe to those countries. Loss of our ability to lawfully transfer personal data out of Europe to these or any other jurisdictions may cause reluctance or refusal by current or prospective European customers to use our products, and we may be required to increase our data processing capabilities in Europe at significant expense. Additionally, other countries outside of Europe have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Further, Brexit has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the UK, where our operations involve the processing of EU residents\u2019 personal data. In particular, as a result of Brexit, it is unclear whether, the UK will enact data protection legislation equivalent to the GDPR and how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated. Thus, it is uncertain whether our operations in, and data transfers to and from, the UK can comply with UK and EU law. Privacy and data security laws in the US are also increasingly complex and changing rapidly. Many states have enacted laws requiring companies to implement reasonable data security measures, and laws in all states and US territories require businesses to notify affected individuals and governmental entities of the occurrence of certain security breaches affecting personal information. These laws are not consistent, and compliance with them in the event of a widespread data breach may be complex and costly. States have also begun to introduce more comprehensive privacy legislation. Just over a month after the GDPR took effect, the California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents certain rights similar to the individual rights given under the GDPR, including the right to access and delete their personal information, opt-out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA prohibits discrimination against individuals who exercise their privacy rights, provides for civil penalties for violations, and creates a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Since the enactment of the CCPA, new privacy and data security laws have been proposed in more than half of the US states and in the US Congress, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the US. The CCPA itself will expand substantially when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the \u201cCPRA\u201d), which California voters approved in November 2020, takes effect on January 1, 2023. The CPRA will, among other things, restrict use of certain categories of sensitive personal information that we handle; further restrict the sharing of personal information; establish restrictions on the retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy and data security laws and regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services, lead to negative publicity, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations of or commitments to customers, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts with customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. These laws could also impact our ability to offer, or our customers\u2019 ability to deploy, our services in certain locations. The costs, burdens, and potential liabilities imposed by existing privacy laws could be compounded if other jurisdictions in the US or abroad begin to adopt similar laws. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established, or may establish, new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certifications and other standards established by third parties, such as ISO 27001 and ISO 27701. If we are unable to earn and maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy and security may cause our customers\u2019 customers, members, employees, or other stakeholders to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. Any of these matters could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operational results. We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. Our products are subject to export controls, including the Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, and exports of our products must be made in compliance with these laws. If we fail to comply with these US export control laws and import laws, including US Customs regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to: substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export, or re-export licenses or authorizations, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular sale may be time-consuming and is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, the US export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to US embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, and persons. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being provided to US sanctions targets, our products and services could be delivered to those targets or provided by our distributors despite such precautions. Any such shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, and reputational harm. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting or licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes to our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Risks Related to International Operations Fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies could result in foreign currency gains and losses. We conduct our business in various countries across the world. As we continue to expand our international operations, we will become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies and operating in foreign countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Further, our overseas subsidiaries\u2019 results are also impacted by exchange rates affecting the carrying value of US dollar denominated intercompany loans with us. Because we conduct business in currencies other than US dollars, but report our results of operations in US dollars, fluctuations in the exchange rates of these foreign currencies, including any fluctuations caused by uncertainties following Brexit, may hinder our ability to predict our future results and earnings and materially impact our business, financial condition, and operating results. Due to our legal structure and the currencies in which we operate, any fluctuations in the exchange rates of the British pound may be particularly impactful. Additionally, the impact of fluctuations may not be immediately apparent in the constant currency results we present, because we present these results based on prior period exchange rates. We may engage in foreign currency hedging. When we hedge our foreign currency exposure, we may not be able to completely eliminate the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rates. We currently have a number of international offices and may expand our international operations. Doing business internationally has unique risks with respect to operational execution and regulatory compliance. We currently have international offices in several countries, and we may expand our international operations into other countries in the future. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully, our business and operating results will suffer. Conducting our business internationally, particularly with expansion into countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to a variety of risks that that we do not necessarily face to the same degree in the US. These risks may lead to a decreased demand for, or restrict our ability to sell or provide, our products, and include, among others: \u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties, or other trade restrictions; \u2022differing labor regulations; \u2022regulations relating to data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information; \u2022potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the UK Bribery Act; \u2022greater difficulty in supporting and localizing our products; \u2022unrest and/or changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s social, political, legal, health, or economic conditions, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic; \u2022challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, controls, policies, benefits, and compliance programs; \u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations including any fluctuations caused by uncertainties following Brexit; \u2022limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection; \u2022competition with companies or other services that understand local markets better than we do; \u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls; and \u2022restrictions on repatriation of earnings. Our operations could be materially affected by changes in domestic and foreign economic, political, or legal conditions. For example, we are continuing to monitor developments related to Brexit, which occurred at the end of December 2020 and could have significant implications for our business. Lack of clarity about future UK laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU rules and regulations to replace or replicate, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, intellectual property rights, supply chain logistics, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, immigration laws, and employment laws, could decrease foreign direct investment in the UK, increase costs, depress economic activity, and restrict access to capital. The political and economic instability created by Brexit has also caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and the value of the British pound currency or other currencies, including the euro, and due to our legal structure, any fluctuations in the exchange rates of the British pound may be particularly impactful. Such a withdrawal from the EU is unprecedented. It is unclear how the UK\u2019s access to the European single market for goods, capital, services, and labor within the EU, or single market, and the wider commercial, legal, and regulatory environment, will impact our UK operations and customers. Our UK operations service customers in the UK as well as in other countries in the EU and the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), and these operations could be disrupted by Brexit, particularly if there is a change in the UK\u2019s relationship to the single market. We may also face new regulatory costs and challenges that could have an adverse effect on our operations. For example, the UK could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members, which may result in increased trade barriers that could make doing business in the EU and the EEA more difficult. Risks Related to Intellectual Property If we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our competitive advantage and brand could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate reduced revenue, and incur costly litigation to protect our rights. Our success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws, and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer, and disclosure of our licensed products may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the US. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information may increase. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances. These agreements may not be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time consuming, and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. If we fail to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights, we may lose valuable assets, generate reduced revenue, and incur costly litigation to protect our rights, which could seriously harm our brand and adversely impact our business. We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights or may find it necessary to enter into licensing arrangements with third parties to settle or forestall such claims, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. There is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Our success depends in part upon our not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. However, our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry or, in some cases, our technology or products. From time to time, such third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may actually be found to be infringing such rights. Moreover, we may be subject to claims of infringement with respect to technology that we acquire or license from third parties. The risk that we could be subject to infringement claims is increasing as the number of products and companies competing with our solutions grows. Any claims or litigation could require the commitment of substantial time and resources and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty or licensing payments, indemnify our customers, distributors, or other third parties, modify or discontinue the sale of our products, or refund fees, any of which would deplete our resources and adversely impact our business. We have in the past obtained, and may in the future obtain, licenses from third parties to forestall or settle potential claims that our products and technology infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Discussions and negotiations with such third parties, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management resources, either of which could seriously harm our business. Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses. Our agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our products, services, or other contractual obligations. The term of these indemnity provisions generally survives termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. From time to time, we are requested by customers to indemnify them for breach of confidentiality with respect to personal data. Although we normally do not agree to, or contractually limit our liability with respect to, such requests, the existence of such a dispute with a customer may have adverse effects on our customer relationships and reputation. We use open source software in our products, which could subject us to litigation or other actions. We use open source software in our products and services and may use more open source software in the future. From time to time, companies that use open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. In addition, some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network products and services that include open source software to make available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code, at no cost, and/or license such code under the terms of the particular open source license. While we employ practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source software license types, almost none of which has been tested in a court of law, resulting in a lack of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such license types. If we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to expend time and resources to re-engineer our products and services, discontinue the sale of our products, organize a legal defense against claims and allegations regarding our use of open source software, or take other remedial actions. In addition, the use of third-party open source software may expose us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third-parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial condition, or operating results. Risks Related to Reliance on Our Employees If we fail to retain key employees and recruit qualified technical and sales personnel, our business could be harmed. We believe that our success depends on the continued employment of our senior management and other key employees. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. For example: during 2020 our founder, Adam Miller, transitioned from chief executive officer to co-chairman of the board; Phil Saunders, the former chief executive officer of Saba, was appointed by the board to serve as Cornerstone\u2019s new chief executive officer; Brian Swartz resigned from his position as our chief financial officer; and in January 2021 the board appointed Chirag Shah as our new chief financial officer effective February 1, 2021. Changes such as these could disrupt our business. In addition, because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new software and services, we are heavily dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education, background, and industry experience. As we expand our business, our continued success will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified sales, marketing, and operational personnel capable of supporting a larger and more diverse customer base. The loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or sales people could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships. In addition, if any of our key employees joins a competitor or decides to otherwise compete with us, we may experience a material disruption of our operations and development plans, which may cause us to lose customers or increase operating expenses as the attention of our remaining senior managers is diverted to recruit replacements for the departed key employees. Furthermore, foreign nationals who are not US citizens or permanent residents constitute an important part of our US workforce, particularly in the areas of engineering and product development. Our ability to hire and retain these workers and their ability to remain and work in the US are impacted by laws and regulations, as well as by procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies. Changes to US immigration and work authorization laws and regulations, including those recently implemented in the US, can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity. These and any further legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations may impair our ability to hire or retain personnel who are not US citizens or permanent residents, increase our operating expenses, or negatively impact our ability to deliver our products and services, which may materially adversely affect our business or our ability to expand our operations, including internationally. Failure to effectively retain, and continue to increase the productivity of, our direct sales teams will impede our growth. We will need to continue to increase the productivity of and retain our sales and marketing infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and our business. We may engage additional third-party distributors, both domestically and internationally. Identifying, recruiting, and training these people and entities will require significant time, expense, and attention. If we are unable to achieve our expected productivity increases, we may not be able to significantly increase our revenue, profitability, and/or free cash flows. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have suspended non-essential business-related travel and a significant portion of our employees are now working from home which limits the ability of our sales team to visit customers and prospects. This may affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. Our business and operations are experiencing growth and organizational change. If we fail to effectively manage such growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, our business and operating results could be harmed. Our corporate culture focuses on rapid innovation, teamwork, and attention to customer success, all of which we believe have been central to our growth so far. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid growth and organizational change, including growth and organizational change resulting from our acquisition of and subsequent integration with other businesses, such as Saba, as well as organizational change due to workforce reduction plans announced in 2020, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our operational, financial, and management resources. We may continue to expand our international operations into other countries in the future, either organically or through acquisitions. We have also experienced significant growth in the number of users, transactions, and data that our SaaS hosting infrastructure supports. Finally, our organizational structure is becoming more complex as we improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to grow and change in these areas without undermining our corporate culture. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, the quality of our products may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers. Restructuring activities could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy. We have in the past implemented headcount-related restructuring measures, and in the future it may become necessary for us to continue to restructure our business due to worldwide market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy. For example, in 2020, we announced plans to reduce headcount as part of our phased integration with Saba to streamline the organization. This workforce reduction plan and any future restructuring may have other consequences, such as attrition beyond the planned reduction in workforce, a negative effect on employee morale and productivity, or a reduction in our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Risks Related to Tax Issues We are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions. As a multinational organization, we are subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws, or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest, and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could have a material impact on us and our operating results. If we are selected for future examinations that uncover incorrect tax positions, we could be subject to additional taxes, interest, and penalties. Taxing authorities could reallocate our taxable income among our subsidiaries, which could increase our consolidated tax liability. We conduct operations worldwide through subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions pursuant to transfer pricing arrangements between our subsidiaries. If two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries, the tax laws or regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those between unrelated companies dealing at arms\u2019 length and that contemporaneous documentation is maintained to support the transfer prices. While we believe that we operate in compliance with applicable transfer pricing laws and intend to continue to do so, our transfer pricing procedures are not binding on applicable tax authorities. If tax authorities in any of these countries were to successfully challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arm\u2019s length transactions, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these revised transfer prices, which could result in a higher tax liability to us. In addition, if the country from which the income is reallocated does not agree with the reallocation, both countries could tax the same income, resulting in double taxation. If tax authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest and penalties, it would increase our consolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. Changes in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations. New income, sales, use, or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to us. For example, US federal tax legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), enacted many significant changes to the US tax laws. Future guidance from the US Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. For example, legislation enacted on March 27, 2020, entitled the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), modified certain provisions of the Tax Act. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act, the CARES Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Act or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future US tax expense. Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to reduce future tax payments may be subject to limitations. Our US federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, may be carried forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such net operating loss carryforwards expire. Under the Tax Act, as modified by the CARES Act, US federal net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such US federal net operating losses in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or the CARES Act. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. We may therefore be limited in the portion of net operating loss carryforwards and other applicable tax attributes that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for US federal income tax purposes. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. General Risk Factors As a public company, we are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. If our internal control over financial reporting is ineffective, our financial reporting may not be accurate, complete, and timely and our auditors may be unable to attest to its effectiveness when required, thus adversely affecting investor confidence in our company. We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our auditors also need to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have incurred and continue to incur significant costs assessing our system of internal control over financial reporting and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may discover, and may not be able to remediate, future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, or we may be unable to complete our evaluation, testing or any required remediation in a timely fashion. Further, to the extent we acquire other businesses, such as Saba, a privately held company we acquired in April 2020, during the course of integration we may find that the acquired company did not have a sufficiently robust system of internal controls and we may discover significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, any of which could require us to implement changes to our existing system of internal control over financial reporting. Failure of our internal controls over financial reporting could cause our financial reporting to be inaccurate, incomplete, or delayed. Moreover, even if there is no inaccuracy, incompletion, or delay of reporting results, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert, and our auditors will be unable to affirm, that our internal control environment is effective, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and our ability to meet the applicable covenants in our credit agreement. Additionally, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to prevent error could materially adversely impact us. The trading price of our common stock may be volatile. The trading price of our common stock has at times been volatile and could continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies operating in such markets. The market price of our common stock may be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including as a result of factors unrelated to our operating performance and prospects. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including: \u2022our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies; \u2022the financial or non-financial metric projections we provide to the public, including the failure of the projections to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, and any changes in these projections or our failure to meet or exceed these projections; \u2022the overall performance of the equity markets; \u2022developments with respect to intellectual property rights; \u2022publication of unfavorable research reports about us or our industry or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts; \u2022speculation in the press or investment community; \u2022the size of our public float; \u2022natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemic diseases (such as COVID-19), or terrorist acts; \u2022actual or perceived data security incidents that we or our service providers may suffer; \u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new technologies, acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; and \u2022global economic, legal, and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance. In the past, some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. The issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions, our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue all of these shares that are not already outstanding without any action or approval by our stockholders. We intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions in the future. We may pay for such acquisitions, partly or in full, through the issuance of additional equity. For example, we issued 1,110,352 shares of our common stock in connection with our April 2020 acquisition of Saba. Any future issuance of shares in connection with our acquisitions, the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by existing investors. Conversion of our Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Convertible Notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. The conversion of some or all of our Convertible Notes, to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. The Convertible Notes and the underlying shares issuable upon conversion of such notes may be sold in the public market upon issuance. Any sales of the Convertible Notes or our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company. Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws include provisions that: \u2022authorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by the board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock; \u2022create a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms, (except that we began the process of phasing out our classified board of directors in 2019 and, starting at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, all directors elected by stockholders will be elected to one-year terms); \u2022provide that our directors who have been elected to serve a three-year term (or any director appointed to fill a vacancy caused by the death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, or other removal of such director) may be removed only for cause until the expiration of such three-year term; \u2022eliminate the ability of stockholders to act by written consent; \u2022specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer, or the president; \u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors; \u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the vote of a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; \u2022specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and \u2022require supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our charter documents. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. The nature of our business requires the application of complex revenue and expense recognition rules. Changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported operating results. The accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the Securities and Exchange Commission and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. In addition, many companies\u2019 accounting disclosures are being subjected to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. We may invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We sometimes invest in, advise, and collaborate with companies building innovative business applications that support the continued expansion of our market reach. We have made, and from time to time may continue to make, strategic investments in privately-held companies. The privately-held companies in which we may invest are inherently risky. The technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately-held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as US publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. Failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions both domestic and abroad. We leverage third parties, including channel partners, to sell subscriptions to our solutions and conduct our business abroad. We and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot guarantee that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Any violation of the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act, or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from US or other government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results, and prospects. Our investment portfolio is subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, market, and interest rate risks, any of which could impair the market value of our investments and harm our financial results. At December 31, 2020, we had $153.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Although we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to manage our investment portfolio, our investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, market, and interest rate risks. We liquidated a significant portion of our investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2020 to partially fund the cash consideration we paid in connection with our April 2020 acquisition of Saba. We do not anticipate having a material investment portfolio for the foreseeable future. Because the market value of fixed-rate debt securities may be adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates, our future investment income may fall short of expectations if interest rates rise. In addition, we may suffer losses if we are forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates. Currently, we use financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure. For additional information refer to Note 4 - Debt and Note 10 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets. Any investment securities that we hold, or the issuers of such securities, could be subject to review for possible downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments. Changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the perceived market risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value. In the event of adverse conditions in the credit and capital markets, and to the extent we make future investments, our investment portfolio may be impacted, and we could determine that some or all of our investments experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment, which could adversely impact our financial position and operating results."}

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties and all other information contained or referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment. Risks related to our business Legislative and regulatory changes can influence demand for our solutions and could adversely affect our business. The market for our solutions depends in part on the requirements of the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Any legislation or rulemaking substantially affecting the content or method of delivery of documents to be filed with these regulatory bodies could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, evolving market practices in light of regulatory developments could adversely affect the demand for our solutions. Uncertainty caused by political change in the United States and European Union heightens regulatory uncertainty in these areas. For example, the SEC has proposed a rule to require certain over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) companies to provide greater transparency to investors and other market participants by requiring that information about the issuer be current and publicly available, which could cause a decrease in the number of publicly traded companies. New legislation, or a significant change in rules, regulations, directives or standards could reduce demand for our products and services. Regulatory changes could also increase expenses as we modify our products and services to comply with new requirements and retain relevancy, impose limitations on our operations, and increase compliance or litigation expense, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The environment in which we compete is highly competitive, which creates adverse pricing pressures and may harm our business and operating results if we cannot compete effectively. Competition across all of our businesses is intense. The speed and accuracy with which we can meet customers\u2019 needs, the price of our services and the quality of our products and supporting services are factors in this competition. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, more established customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing market demands and requirements. We could also be negatively impacted if our competitors reduce prices, add new features, form strategic alliances with other companies, or are acquired by other companies with greater available resources. These competitive pressures to any aspect of our business could reduce our revenue and earnings. Our revenue growth rate in the recent period relating to our Communications business may not be indicative of this business segment\u2019s future performance. We experienced a revenue growth rate of 28% from 2019 to 2020, 45% from 2018 to 2019, 22% from 2017 to 2018 and 55% from 2016 to 2017 with respect to our Communications business. In 2020, much of the growth came from demand for our events products that were upgraded to handle virtual needs in the industry, as well as our ACCESSWIRE news brand, which drove both subscriptions and pay-as-you-go revenues higher than in prior years. In 2019, much of the growth came from the acquisition of VWP in January 2019 and FSCwire in July 2018, while the previous years\u2019 growth was due to the success of our ACCESSWIRE business. Our historical revenue growth rate of the Communications business is not indicative of future growth, and we may not achieve similar revenue growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our revenue or revenue growth for any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth. If we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability and our stock price may be negatively impacted. The success of our cloud-based software largely depends on our ability to provide reliable solutions to our customers. If a customer were to experience a product defect, a disruption in its ability to use our solutions or a security flaw, demand for our solutions could be diminished, we could be subject to substantial liability and our business could suffer. Our product solutions are complex and we often release new features. As such, our solutions could have errors, defects, viruses or security flaws that could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers and harm our reputation and our business. Internet-based software may contain undetected errors or security flaws when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We might from time to time find such defects in our solutions, the detection and correction of which could be time consuming and costly. Since our customers use our solutions for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in access, security flaws, viruses, data corruption or other performance problems with our solutions could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. If that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, could delay or withhold payment to us or may make claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. We could also lose future sales. In addition, a security breach of our solutions could result in our future business prospects being materially adversely impacted. A substantial portion of our business is derived from our ACCESSWIRE brand, which is dependent on technology and key partners. As noted, our ACCESSWIRE brand has been vital to the increase in revenue associated with our Communications business. ACCESSWIRE is dependent upon several key partners for news distribution, some of which are also partners that we rely on for other shareholder communications services. During the second quarter of 2019, one of our key partners made an industry-wide decision to no longer accept investor commentary content. A significant portion of our historical ACCESSWIRE revenue was generated from this type of content, which has significantly affected revenue going forward. Further disruption in any of these partnership relationships could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results and the inability to procure new key partners could impact the growth of the ACCESSWIRE brand, particularly with respect to public company news distribution. Additionally, ACCESSWIRE is highly dependent on technology and any performance issues with this technology could have a material impact on our ability to serve our customers and thus our ability to generate revenue. Failure to manage our growth may adversely affect our business or operations. Since 2013, we have experienced overall growth in our business, customer base, employee headcount and operations, and we expect to continue to grow our business over the next several years. This growth places a significant strain on our executive management team and employees and on our operating and financial systems. To manage our future growth, we must continue to scale our business functions, improve our financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures and expand and train our work force. In particular, we grew from twenty-four employees and contractors as of December 31, 2012 to ninety-one (including 5 independent contractors) as of December 31, 2020. We anticipate that additional investments in sales personnel, infrastructure and research and development spending will be required to: \u25cf scale our operations and increase productivity; \u25cf address the needs of our customers; \u25cf further develop and enhance our existing solutions and offerings; and \u25cf develop new technology. We cannot assure you that our controls, systems and procedures will be adequate to support our future operations or that we will be able to manage our growth effectively. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our market presence in the United States and other current markets or successfully establish our presence in other markets. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in deploying customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties could adversely impact our business performance and results of operations. If we are unable to retain our key employees and attract and retain other qualified personnel, our business could suffer. Our ability to grow and our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our key executives, managers and employees. In addition, many of our individual technical and sales personnel have extensive experience in our business operations and/or have valuable customer relationships that would be difficult to replace. Their departure, if unexpected and unplanned, could cause a disruption to our business. Our competition for these individuals is intense in certain areas of our business. We may not succeed in identifying and retaining the appropriate personnel in key positions. Further, competitors and other entities have in the past recruited and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees, particularly our sales personnel. The loss of the services of our key personnel, the inability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel, particularly technical and sales personnel, could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives, such as the timely introduction of new technology-based products and services, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results The recent COVID-19 outbreak could harm our business and results of operations. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" and on March 11, 2020, declared it to be a pandemic. We have undertaken measures to protect our employees, partners and customers by requiring a majority of our employees to work remotely at certain times. There can be no assurance that these measures will be effective or that we can adopt them without adversely affecting our business operations. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in global financial markets, which may materially decrease spending, demand for our solutions, the viability of our customers and the value of our assets, which would significantly harm our business and results of operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis in our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If we fail to keep our customers\u2019 information confidential or if we handle their information improperly, our business and reputation could be significantly and adversely affected. If we fail to keep customers\u2019 proprietary information and documentation confidential, we may lose existing customers and potential new customers and may expose them to significant loss of revenue based on the premature release of confidential information. While we have security measures in place to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, these measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our service providers (including, without limitation, hosting facilities, disaster recovery providers and software providers) may have access to our customers\u2019 data and could suffer security breaches or data losses that affect our customers\u2019 information. If an actual or perceived security breach or premature release occurs, our reputation could be damaged and we may lose future sales and customers. We may also become subject to civil claims, including indemnity or damage claims in certain customer contracts, or criminal investigations by appropriate authorities, any of which could harm our business and operating results. Furthermore, while our errors and omissions insurance policies include liability coverage for these matters, if we experienced a widespread security breach that impacted a significant number of our customers for whom we have these indemnity obligations, we could be subject to indemnity claims that exceed such coverage. We must adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements to remain competitive. The market and demand for our products and services, to a varying extent, have been characterized by: \u25cf technological change; \u25cf frequent product and service introductions; and \u25cf evolving customer requirements. We believe that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to: \u25cf enhance our existing products and services; \u25cf gain market acceptance. \u25cf successfully develop new products and services that meet increasing customer requirements; and To achieve these goals, we will need to continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing. We may not: \u25cf have sufficient resources to make these investments; \u25cf be successful in developing product and service enhancements or new products and services on a timely basis, if at all; or \u25cf be able to market successfully these enhancements and new products once developed. Further, our products and services may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology. Our business could be harmed if we do not successfully manage the integration of any business that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. These risks include, among other things: \u25cf the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses into our ongoing operations; \u25cf the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; \u25cf the potential for new cyber security risks to existing operations that weren\u2019t previously mitigated: \u25cf the difficulty in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and technology; \u25cf unanticipated expenses and delays relating to completing acquired development projects and technology integration; \u25cf a potential increase in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities, which could restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy; \u25cf the management of geographically remote units; \u25cf the establishment and maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; \u25cf the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel; \u25cf risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience; \u25cf the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses; and \u25cf potential unknown liabilities, such as liability for hazardous substances, or other difficulties associated with acquired businesses. Revenue from Platform id. subscriptions and many of our service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract or subscription period. As a result, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize subscription and support revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically on a quarterly or annual cycle and automatically renew for additional periods. As a result, a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each quarter will be derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. This decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solutions and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our subscription revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenue, which could adversely affect our operating results. We cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. Our business depends substantially on customers renewing their subscriptions with us, specifically Platform id., and expanding their use of our products. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our products after the expiration of their initial subscription period. Given our limited operating history with respect to our subscription business, we may be unable to accurately predict our revenue retention rate. In addition, our customers may renew for shorter contract lengths, lower prices or fewer users. We cannot accurately predict new subscription or expansion rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers\u2019 ability to continue their operations and spending levels and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our products, purchase fewer solutions at the time of renewal, or negotiate a lower price upon renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional solutions and products, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our products to our current customers. If our efforts to sell additional solutions and products to our customers are not successful, our growth and operations may be impeded. In addition, any decline in our customer renewals or failure to convince our customers to broaden their use of our products would harm our future operating results. We continue to transition our business from a services company to a cloud-based platform company, which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results. In 2015, we began our transition from a services company to a cloud-based platform company. As a result of this transition, our ability to forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. We have encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties (which we use to plan our business) are incorrect or change due to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer. We are subject to general litigation and regulatory requirements that may materially adversely affect us. From time to time, we may be involved in disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. We expect that the number and significance of these potential disputes may increase as our business expands and we grow larger. While most of our agreements with customers limit our liability for damages arising from our solutions, we cannot assure you that these contractual provisions will protect us from liability for damages in the event we are sued. Although we carry general liability insurance coverage, our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. New and existing laws make determining our sales and use taxes and income tax rate complex and subject to uncertainty. The computation of sales and use taxes and our provision for income tax is complex, as it is based on the laws of multiple taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the application of complicated rules governing accounting for such tax provisions under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Additionally, provisions for income tax for interim quarters are based on forecasts of our U.S. and non-U.S. effective tax rates for the year and contain numerous assumptions. Various items cannot be accurately forecasted and future events may be treated as discrete to the period in which they occur. Our provision for income tax can be materially impacted by things such as changes in our business, internal restructuring and acquisitions, changes in tax laws and accounting guidance and other regulatory, legislative developments, tax audit determinations, changes in uncertain tax positions, tax deductions attributed to equity compensation and changes in our determination for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. For all of these reasons, our actual income taxes may be materially different than our provision for income tax. We are subject to U.S. and foreign data privacy and protection laws and regulations as well as contractual privacy obligations, and our failure to comply could subject us to fines and damages and would harm our reputation and business. We manage private and confidential information and documentation related to our customers\u2019 finances and transactions, often prior to public dissemination. The use of insider information is highly regulated in the United States and abroad, and violations of securities laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal penalties. In addition, we are subject to the data privacy and protection laws and regulations adopted by federal, state and foreign legislatures and governmental agencies. Data privacy and protection is highly regulated and may become the subject of additional regulation in the future. Privacy laws restrict our storage, use, processing, disclosure, transfer and protection of non-public personal information by our customers or collected from visitors of our website. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. However, it is possible that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with federal, state or international laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, payment card information, personal health information, data or consumer protection, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. The regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is evolving, and various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices, including some directed at providers of mobile and online resources in particular. Our obligations with respect to privacy and data protection may become broader or more stringent. If we are required to change our business activities or revise or eliminate services, or to implement costly compliance measures, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Our business may be affected by factors outside of our control. Our ability to increase sales and deliver and sell our service offerings profitably is subject to a number of risks, including changes to corporate disclosure requirements, regulatory filings and distribution of proxy materials, competitive risks such as the entrance of additional competitors into our market, pricing and competition and risks associated with the marketing of new services in order to remain competitive. If potential customers take a long time to evaluate the use of our products, we could incur additional selling expenses and decrease our profitability. The acceptance of our services depends on a number of factors, including the nature and size of the potential customer base, the effectiveness of our system, and the extent of the commitment being made by the potential customer, and is difficult to predict. Currently, our sales and marketing expenses per customer are fairly low. If potential customers take longer than we expect to decide whether to use our services and require that we travel to their sites, present more marketing material, or spend more time in completing the sales process, our selling expenses could increase, and decrease our profitability. The seasonality of business makes it difficult to predict future results based on specific quarters. A greater portion of our printing, distribution and solicitation of proxy materials business will be processed during the second quarter of our fiscal year. Therefore, the seasonality of our revenue makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific quarter and could affect an investor\u2019s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. To balance the seasonal activity of print, distribution and solicitation of proxy materials, we will attempt to continue to grow other revenues linked to predictable periodic activity that is not cyclical in nature. If we are unable to successfully develop and timely introduce new technology-based products or enhance existing technology-based products, our business may be adversely affected. In the past few years, we have expended significant resources to develop and introduce new technology-based products and improve and enhance our existing technology-based products in an attempt to maintain or increase our sales. The long-term success of new or enhanced technology-based products may depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the following: anticipating and effectively addressing customer preferences and demand, the success of our sales and marketing efforts, timely and successful development, changes in governmental regulations and the quality of or defects in our products. The development of our technology-based products is complex and costly, and we typically have multiple technology-based products in development at the same time. Given the complexity, we occasionally have experienced, and could experience in the future, delays in completing the development and introduction of new and enhanced technology-based products. Problems in the design or quality of our products or services may also have an adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition, and operating results. Unanticipated problems in developing technology-based products could also divert substantial development resources, which may impair our ability to develop new technology-based products and enhancements of such products, and could substantially increase our costs. If new or enhanced product and service introductions are delayed or not successful, we may not be able to achieve an acceptable return, if any, on our development efforts, and our business may be adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Common Stock; Liquidity Risks The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which could lead to losses for stockholders. The stock prices of smaller public companies can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or out of proportion to the operating performance of such companies. We expect our stock price to be similarly volatile. These broad market fluctuations may continue and could harm our stock price. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of our prospects or companies in our market could also depress our stock price, regardless of our actual results. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include: \u25cf variations in operating results; \u25cf announcements of strategic alliances or significant agreements by the Company or by competitors; \u25cf recruitment or departure of key personnel; \u25cf litigation, legislation, regulation of all or part of our business; and \u25cf changes in the estimates of operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analyst that elect to follow our common stock. If securities or industry analysts issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our common stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock or trading volume to decline. The market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by market conditions affecting the stock markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations on the NYSE American. Market conditions may result in volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, in each case being unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance. A weak global economy could also contribute to extreme volatility of the markets, which may have an effect on the market price of our common stock. We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We paid dividends in 2012, part of 2013 and from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the third quarter of 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced that we would no longer be declaring quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future in order to invest such money in our business. There can be no assurances that dividends will be paid in the future in the form of either cash or stock. Our Board of Directors has the ability without stockholder approval to issue shares of preferred stock with terms detrimental to the holders of our common stock. We currently have authorized but unissued \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. Without the vote of our shareholders, the Board of Directors may issue such preferred stock with both economic and voting rights and preferences senior to those of the holders of our common stock. Any such issuances may negatively impact the ultimate benefits to the holders of our common stock in the event of a liquidation event and may have the effect of preventing a change of control and could dilute the voting power of our common stock and reduce the market price of our common stock. Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of common stock. Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted, which could result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock. New investors in subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. In addition, if outstanding stock options are exercised or when outstanding restricted stock units are settled in shares, current shareholders will experience dilution. We will continue to incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that would not be incurred as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time consuming and costly. Many of these costs recur annually. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. A failure to maintain adequate internal controls over our financial and management systems could cause errors in our financial reporting, which could cause a loss of investor confidence and result in a decline in the price of our common stock. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. If we have a material weaknesses or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on a timely basis could result in us being subject to regulatory action and a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, both of which in turn could cause the market value of our common stock to decline and affect our ability to raise capital. Because we are a smaller reporting company, our independent registered public accounting firm was not required to and did not perform an audit of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020."}

Risk Factors A description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business, industry and ownership of our ordinary shares is set forth below. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to invest in our ordinary shares. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our ordinary shares could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the economic environment may exacerbate the risks described below, any of which could have a material impact on us. This situation is continuously changing and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently. Summary of Risk Factors The following is a summary of the key risks and uncertainties associated with our business, industry and ownership of our ordinary shares. The below summary does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained in the subheadings below. \u2022If we do not appropriately manage future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. \u2022We have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve profitability on a consistent basis or at all or positive cash flows on a consistent basis. \u2022Our future growth, business and results of operations will be harmed if we are not able to keep pace with technological and competitive developments, increase sales of our subscriptions to new and existing customers, renew existing customers\u2019 subscriptions, increase adoption of our SaaS offerings, respond effectively to evolving markets or offer high quality support services. \u2022The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could harm our business and results of operations. \u2022Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. \u2022Our decision to no longer offer Elasticsearch and Kibana under an open source license may harm the adoption of Elasticsearch and Kibana. \u2022We could be negatively impacted if the Elastic License or the Server Side Public License under which some of our software is licensed are not enforceable. \u2022Because of the permissive rights accorded to third parties under our open source and source available licenses, there are limited technological barriers to entry into the markets in which we compete. \u2022We may not be able to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities. \u2022Because we recognize a significant portion of the revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant subscription period, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our results of operations. \u2022A real or perceived defect, security vulnerability, error, or performance failure in our software could cause us to lose revenue, damage our reputation, and expose us to liability. \u2022Incorrect implementation or use of our software could negatively affect our business, operations, financial results, and growth prospects. \u2022Third parties may offer inadequate or defective implementations of software that we have previously made available under an open source license and our reputation could be harmed. \u2022Breaches of security measures or unauthorized access to private or proprietary data may result in our software being perceived as not secure, customers reducing or stopping usage of our products, and we may incur significant liabilities. \u2022Interruptions or performance problems, and our reliance on technologies from third parties may adversely affect our business operations and financial results. \u2022If our channel partners fail to perform or we are unable to maintain successful relationships with them or our other partners, our ability to market, sell and distribute our solution will be more limited, and our results of operations could be harmed. \u2022Failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and results of operations. \u2022We could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement, misappropriation or violation of another party\u2019s intellectual property rights, including as a result of the indemnity provisions in various agreements. \u2022Our use of third-party open source software within our products could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation. \u2022One of our marketing strategies is to offer some of our product features for free and to provide free trials to some of our paid features, and we may not be able to realize the benefits of this strategy. \u2022Our international business exposes us to several risks, and if we are not successful in sustaining and expanding our international business, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be harmed. \u2022A portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks. \u2022Our business is subject to a variety of government and industry regulations, as well as other obligations, related to privacy, data protection and information security and compliance with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws. \u2022The market price for our ordinary shares has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. \u2022The concentration of our share ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters. \u2022Dutch law and our articles of association include certain anti-takeover provisions. \u2022If industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our ordinary shares, our share price and trading volume could decline. \u2022Claims of U.S. civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us. \u2022We may fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting. Risks Related to our Business and Industry Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth, and if we do not appropriately manage future growth, if any, or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be adversely affected. We have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our offerings. Our employee headcount and number of customers have increased significantly. For example, our total number of customers has grown from over 2,800 as of April 30, 2017 to over 15,000 as of April 30, 2021. Further, our employee headcount is growing as we modify our pace of hiring in light of our growth plans. The growth and expansion of our business and offerings places a continuous and significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. In addition, as customers adopt our technology for an increasing number of use cases, we have had to support more complex commercial relationships. We may not be able to hire, train and retain enough qualified employees, and we may not be able to hire and train new employees fast enough, to maintain our growth plans. We must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, our relationships with various partners and other third parties, and our ability to manage headcount and processes in an efficient manner to manage our growth to date and any future growth effectively. We may not be able to sustain the diversity and pace of improvements to our offerings successfully or implement systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner or in a manner that does not negatively affect our results of operations. Our failure to improve our systems, processes, and controls, or their failure to operate in the intended manner, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to forecast our revenue, expenses, and earnings accurately, or to prevent losses. As we expand our business and operate as a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture while managing our employee growth. Any failure to manage our anticipated growth and related organizational changes in a manner that preserves our culture could negatively impact future growth and achievement of our business objectives. Additionally, our productivity and the quality of our offerings may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. Failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, negatively affect our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our offerings, and harm our results of operations. We have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve profitability on a consistent basis or at all, and may not be able to achieve positive cash flows on a consistent basis. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may suffer. We have incurred losses in all years since our incorporation. We incurred a net loss of $129.4 million, $167.2 million and, $102.3 million in the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $613.3 million as of April 30, 2021. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to enhance our offerings, broaden our customer base and pursue larger transactions, expand our sales and marketing activities, expand our operations, hire additional employees, and continue to develop our technology. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently, or at all, to offset these higher expenses. Revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons, including slowing demand for our offerings, increasing competition, or economic downturns, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. You should not consider our revenue growth in recent periods as indicative of our future performance. Any failure to increase our revenue or grow our business could prevent us from achieving profitability at all or on a consistent basis, which would cause our business, financial condition, and results of operations to suffer. Additionally, although we generated positive cash flow in fiscal 2021, any failure to grow our business could prevent us from achieving positive cash flow on a consistent basis, which would cause our business, financial condition, and results of operations to suffer. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. The market for our products is highly competitive, quickly evolving, and subject to rapid changes in technology. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including the following: \u2022product capabilities, including speed, scale, and relevance, with which to power search experiences; \u2022an extensible product \u201cstack\u201d that enables developers to build a wide variety of solutions; \u2022powerful and flexible technology that can manage a broad variety and large volume of data; \u2022ease of deployment and ease of use; \u2022ability to address a variety of evolving customer needs and use cases; \u2022strength and execution of sales and marketing strategies; \u2022flexible deployment model across public or private clouds, hybrid environments, or traditional on-premises environments; \u2022productized solutions engineered to be rapidly adopted to address specific applications; \u2022mindshare with developers and IT executives; \u2022adoption of products by many types of users and decision makers (developers, architects, DevOps personnel, IT professionals, security analysts, and departmental and organizational leaders); \u2022enterprise-grade technology that is secure and reliable; \u2022size of customer base and level of user adoption; \u2022quality of training, consulting, and customer support; \u2022brand awareness and reputation; and \u2022low total cost of ownership. We face competition from both established and emerging competitors. Our current primary competitors generally fall into the following categories: \u2022For Enterprise Search (app search, site search, and workplace search): incumbent offerings such as Solr (open source offering), Lucidworks Fusion, search tools including Google Custom Search Engine (an advertisement-based site search tool with limited user controls), and workplace search tools including Coveo, Endeca (owned by Oracle) and Autonomy (owned by Micro Focus). \u2022For Observability (logging, metrics, APM, and uptime monitoring): software vendors with specific observability solutions to analyze logging data, metrics, APM data, or infrastructure uptime, such as Splunk, New Relic, Dynatrace, AppDynamics (owned by Cisco Systems) and Datadog. \u2022For Security (SIEM and endpoint security): security analytics solutions vendors such as Splunk and Azure Sentinel (by Microsoft) and endpoint security vendors such as CrowdStrike, Carbon Black (owned by VMware), McAfee and Symantec (owned by Broadcom). \u2022Certain cloud hosting providers and managed service providers, including Amazon Web Services, that offer products based on older Elastic Stack releases. These offerings are not supported by Elastic and come without any of Elastic\u2019s proprietary features, whether free or paid. Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, stronger brand recognition, broader global distribution and presence, more established relationships with current or potential customers and partners, and larger customer bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer preferences. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching and successful sales and marketing campaigns, have more experienced sales professionals, execute more successfully on their go-to-market strategy and have greater access to more markets and decision makers, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies which may allow them to build larger customer bases than we have. New start-up companies that innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may develop similar offerings that compete with our offerings or that achieve greater market acceptance than our offerings. This could attract customers away from our offerings and reduce our market share. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position would weaken, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and may increase the risks associated with your investment. We were founded in 2012. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries, including the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected, and the market price of our ordinary shares could decline. Further, we have limited historical financial data, and we operate in a rapidly evolving market. As such, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market. If we are not able to keep pace with technological and competitive developments, our business will be harmed. The market for search technologies, including enterprise search, observability and security, is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, and changing regulations, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. Our success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products, expand the use cases of our products, anticipate and respond to changing customer needs, requirements and preferences, and develop and introduce in a timely manner new offerings that keep pace with technological and competitive developments. We have in the past experienced delays in releasing new products, deployment options and product enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future. As a result, in the past, some of our customers deferred purchasing our products until the next upgrade was released. Future delays or problems in the installation or implementation of our new releases may cause customers to forgo purchases of our products and purchase those of our competitors instead. Additionally, the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product releases, the availability of software components for new products, the effective management of development and other spending in connection with anticipated demand for new products, the availability of newly developed products, and the risk that new products may have bugs, errors, or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. We have in the past experienced bugs, errors, or other defects or deficiencies in new products and product updates and may have similar experiences in the future. Furthermore, our ability to increase the usage of our products depends, in part, on the development of new use cases for our products, which is typically driven by our developer community and may be outside of our control. We also have invested, and may continue to invest, in the acquisition of complementary businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets that expand the products that we can offer our customers, such as our acquisition of Endgame in October 2019. We may make these investments without being certain that they will result in products or enhancements that will be accepted by existing or prospective customers. Additionally, even if we are able to develop new products and product enhancements, we cannot ensure that they will achieve market acceptance. If we are unable to successfully enhance our existing products to meet evolving customer requirements, increase adoption and usage of our products, develop new products, or if our efforts to increase the usage of our products are more expensive than we expect, then our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. The markets for some of our products are evolving, and our future success depends on the growth and expansion of these markets and our ability to adapt and respond effectively to evolving markets. The markets for certain of our products, such as our Enterprise Search, Observability and Security solutions, are evolving and our products are relatively new in these markets. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict continued customer adoption and renewals for these products, customers\u2019 demand for these products, the size, growth rate, expansion, and longevity of these markets, the entry of competitive products, or the success of existing competitive products. Our ability to penetrate these evolving markets depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our products. If these markets do not continue to grow as expected, or if we are unable to anticipate or react to changes in these markets, our competitive position would weaken, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could harm our business and results of operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations, negatively impacting worldwide economic activity. We have taken precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate. The continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of infection rates in certain regions has caused us to continue to modify our business practices (including suspending employee travel, adapting employee work locations, and holding events and trainings virtually), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. The full extent to which COVID-19 and our precautionary measures may continue to impact our business will depend on future developments, which continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, including but not limited to, the duration and geographic spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, future spikes of COVID-19 infections resulting in additional preventative measures to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus, the effectiveness, distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, including the vaccines\u2019 efficacy against emerging COVID-19 variants, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. It has been and, until the COVID-19 pandemic is contained and global economic activity stabilizes, will continue to be more difficult for us to forecast our operating results. The magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity remains uncertain and could negatively impact our sales and marketing efforts, our ability to enter into customer contracts in a timely manner, our international expansion efforts, our ability to deliver professional services, our ability to recruit employees across the organization which, in turn, could have longer term effects on our sales pipeline, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business. Additionally, as we begin to re-open certain of our offices where local authorities have indicated it is safe to do so, our efforts to re-open them safely may not be successful, could expose our personnel to health risks and could involve additional costs that may adversely affect our business. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the operations of our customers, vendors, channel partners and government entities for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns, all of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations, including cash flows. Further, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has varied significantly across different industries with certain industries experiencing increased demand for their products and services as the needs of the economy shift, while others have struggled to maintain demand for their products and services consistent with historical levels. Because we have a limited history in understanding these impacts, our ability to adapt our sales and marketing initiatives to such changes may be uncertain and our ability to forecast rates of customer retention and expansion may be negatively impacted. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession, economic downturn, or increased unemployment that has occurred or may occur in the future. There has been increased scrutiny of business (including technology) spending by our customers and prospective customers, particularly in industries most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, longer sales cycles, as well as reduced demand for our solutions, customers failing to pay us under the terms of our agreements, increased cyber threats, lower renewal rates by our customers and increased competition, all of which could result in a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial condition. For instance, our Net Expansion Rate declined to below 130% at the end of fiscal 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused customers to expand their spending with us at a slower rate than before the COVID-19 pandemic. While we have developed and continue to develop plans intended to help mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on our business, these efforts may not be effective and a protracted economic downturn may limit the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts. Our operating results are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. Our results of operations, including our revenue, cost of revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and deferred revenue, have fluctuated from quarter-to-quarter in the past and may continue to vary significantly in the future so that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, may be difficult to predict, and may or may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include: \u2022our ability to attract new and retain existing customers; \u2022the loss of existing customers; \u2022customer renewal rates; \u2022our ability to successfully expand our business in the U.S. and internationally; \u2022our ability to foster an ecosystem of developers and users to expand the use cases of our products; \u2022our ability to gain new partners and retain existing partners; \u2022fluctuations in the growth rate of the overall market that our products address; \u2022fluctuations in the mix of our revenue, which may impact our gross margins and operating income; \u2022the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business and operations, including investments in sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative resources; \u2022network outages or performance degradation of Elastic Cloud; \u2022actual or perceived breaches of, or failures relating to, privacy, data protection or information security; \u2022additions or departures of key personnel; \u2022the impact of catastrophic events, man-made problems such as terrorism, natural disasters and public health epidemics and pandemics; \u2022general political, economic, industry and market conditions, including developments resulting from the change of administration in the United States; \u2022increases or decreases in the number of elements of our subscriptions or pricing changes upon any renewals of customer agreements; \u2022changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; \u2022the budgeting cycles and purchasing practices of customers; \u2022decisions by potential customers to purchase alternative solutions; \u2022decisions by potential customers to develop in-house solutions as alternatives to our products; \u2022insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, which could adversely affect their ability to purchase or pay for our offerings; \u2022our ability to collect timely on invoices or receivables; \u2022delays in our ability to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders; \u2022the cost and potential outcomes of future litigation or other disputes; \u2022future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; \u2022our overall effective tax rate, including impacts caused by any reorganization in our corporate tax structure and any new legislation or regulatory developments; \u2022fluctuations in stock-based compensation expense; \u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; \u2022the timing and success of new offerings introduced by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or partners; \u2022the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies; and \u2022other risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The impact of one or more of the foregoing or other factors may cause our operating results to vary significantly. For example, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown and continues to evolve rapidly, and could result in material adverse changes in our results of operations for an unknown period of time as the virus and its related political, social and economic impacts spread. Such fluctuations could cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, which could cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits, which could have an adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to increase sales of our subscriptions to new customers, sell additional subscriptions to our existing customers, or expand the value of our existing customers\u2019 subscriptions, our future revenue and results of operations will be harmed. We offer certain features of our products with no payment required. Customers purchase subscriptions in order to gain access to additional functionality and support. Our future success depends on our ability to sell our subscriptions to new customers, including to large enterprises, and to expand the deployment of our offerings with existing customers by selling paid subscriptions to our existing users and expanding the value and number of existing customers\u2019 subscriptions. Our ability to sell new subscriptions depends on a number of factors, including the prices of our offerings, the prices of products offered by our competitors, and the budgets of our customers. We also face difficulty in displacing the products of incumbent competitors. In addition, a significant aspect of our sales and marketing focus is to expand deployments within existing customers. The rate at which our existing customers purchase additional subscriptions and expand the value of existing subscriptions depends on a number of factors, including customers\u2019 level of satisfaction with our offerings, the nature and size of the deployments, the desire to address additional use cases, and the perceived need for additional features, as well as general economic conditions. If our existing customers do not purchase additional subscriptions or expand the value of their subscriptions, our Net Expansion Rate may decline. We rely in large part on our customers to identify new use cases for our products in order to expand such deployments and grow our business. If our customers do not recognize the potential of our offerings, our business would be materially and adversely affected. If our efforts to sell subscriptions to new customers and to expand deployments at existing customers are not successful, our total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline and our business will suffer. If our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, it could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewals of existing subscriptions. Our customers have no contractual obligation to renew their subscriptions after the completion of their subscription term. Our subscriptions for self-managed deployments typically range from one to three years, while many of our Elastic Cloud customers purchase subscriptions either on a month-to-month basis or on a committed contract of at least one year in duration. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their satisfaction with our products and our customer support, our products\u2019 ability to integrate with new and changing technologies, the frequency and severity of product outages, our product uptime or latency, and the pricing of our, or competing, products. If our customers renew their subscriptions, they may renew for shorter subscription terms or on other terms that are less economically beneficial to us. We may not accurately predict future renewal trends. If our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, or renew on less favorable terms, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline. Our decision to no longer offer Elasticsearch and Kibana under an open source license may harm the adoption of Elasticsearch and Kibana. In February 2021, with the release of version 7.11 of the Elastic Stack, we changed the source code of Elasticsearch and Kibana that had historically been licensed under Apache 2.0, to be dual licensed under the Elastic License 2.0 (\u201cELv2\u201d) and the Server Side Public License Version 1.0 (\u201cSSPL\u201d), at the user\u2019s election. Neither the Elastic License nor the SSPL has been approved by the Open Source Initiative or is included in the Free Software Foundation\u2019s list of free software licenses. Further, neither has been interpreted by any court. While the vast majority of downloads of Elasticsearch and Kibana from mid-2018 through early 2021 were licensed under the Elastic License, the removal of the Apache 2.0 alternative could negatively impact certain developers for whom the availability of an open source license was important. In addition, some developers and the companies for whom they work may be hesitant to download or upgrade to new versions of Elasticsearch or Kibana under the Elastic License or SSPL because of uncertainty around how these licenses may be interpreted and enforced. Other developers, including competitors of Elastic such as Amazon, have announced that they have \u201cforked\u201d Elasticsearch and Kibana. In doing so, they will develop a new product based on the software, which they claim will continue to be licensed under Apache 2.0. The combination of uncertainty around our dual license model and the potential competition from the forked versions of our software may negatively impact adoption of Elasticsearch and Kibana, which in turn could lead to reduced brand and product awareness, ultimately leading to a decline in paying customers, which could harm our ability to grow our business or achieve profitability. We could be negatively impacted if the Elastic License or SSPL under which some of our software is licensed are not enforceable. We make the source code of our products available under Apache 2.0, the Elastic License, or dual licensed under the Elastic License and SSPL, depending on the product and version. Apache 2.0 is a permissive open source license that allows licensees to freely copy, modify and distribute Apache 2.0-licensed software provided that they meet certain conditions. The Elastic License is our proprietary source available license. The Elastic License permits licensees to use, copy, modify and distribute the licensed software provided that they do not offer access to the software as a cloud service, interfere with the license key or remove proprietary notices. SSPL is a source available license that is based on the GNU Affero General Public License (\u201cAGPL\u201d) open source license and permits licensees to copy, modify and distribute SSPL-licensed software, but expressly requires licensees that offer the SSPL-licensed software as a third-party service to open source all of the software that they use to offer such service. We rely upon the enforceability of the restrictions set forth in the Elastic License and SSPL to protect our proprietary interests. It is possible that a court could hold that the Elastic License or SSPL are unenforceable. If a court held that the Elastic License or SSPL or certain aspects of these licenses are unenforceable, others may be able to use our software to compete with us in the marketplace in a manner not subject to the restrictions set forth in the Elastic License or SSPL. Because of the permissive rights accorded to third parties under our open source and source available licenses, there are limited technological barriers to entry into the markets in which we compete and it may be relatively easy for competitors, some of whom may have greater resources than we have, to enter our markets and compete with us. Anyone may obtain access to source code for the features of our software that we have licensed under open source or source available licenses. Depending on the product and version of the Elastic software, this source code is either available under Apache 2.0, SSPL, or the Elastic License. Each of these licenses allow anyone, subject to compliance with the conditions of the applicable license, to redistribute our software in modified or unmodified form and use it to compete in our markets. Such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies, due to the rights granted to licensees of open source and source available software. It is possible for competitors to develop their own software, including software based on our products, potentially reducing the demand for our products and putting pricing pressure on our subscriptions. For example, Amazon offers some of the features that we had previously made available under an open source license as part of its Amazon Web Services offering. As such, Amazon competes with us for potential customers, and while Amazon cannot provide our proprietary software, Amazon\u2019s offerings may reduce the demand for our offerings and the pricing of Amazon\u2019s offerings may limit our ability to adjust the price of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressure or the availability of new software will not result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our ability to grow our business will depend, in part, on the expansion and adoption of our SaaS offerings. We believe our future success will depend, in part, on the growth in the adoption of Elastic Cloud, our family of SaaS products. We have and will continue to incur substantial costs to develop, sell and support our Elastic Cloud offerings. We believe that we must offer a family of SaaS products to address the market segment that prefers a cloud-based solution to a self-managed solution and that there will be increasing demand for cloud-based offerings of our products. In the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Elastic Cloud contributed 27%, 22% and 17% of our total revenue, respectively. However, as the use of cloud-based computing solutions is rapidly evolving, it is difficult to predict the potential growth, if any, of general market adoption, customer adoption and retention rates of our cloud-based offerings. There could be decreased demand for our cloud-based offerings due to reasons within or outside of our control, including, among other things, lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges with bringing cloud offerings to market and maintaining those offerings, security or privacy concerns, our inability to properly manage and support our cloud-based offerings, competing technologies and products, weakening economic conditions, and decreases in corporate spending. For example, Amazon Web Services offers SaaS products based on older Elastic Stack releases. As such, Amazon competes with us for potential customers, and while Amazon cannot provide our proprietary software, Amazon's offerings may reduce the demand for our offerings and the pricing of Amazon's offerings may limit our ability to adjust the price of our products. If we are not able to develop, market or deliver cloud-based offerings that satisfy customer requirements technically or commercially, or if our investments in cloud-based offerings do not yield the expected return, or if we are unable to decrease the cost of providing our cloud-based offerings, our business, competitive position, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. If we do not effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities, including expanding and training our sales force, we may be unable to add new customers, increase sales to existing customers or expand the value of our existing customers\u2019 subscriptions and our business will be adversely affected. We dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing initiatives, which require us to invest significant financial and other resources, including in markets in which we have limited or no experience. Our business and results of operations will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts do not generate significant revenue increases or increases that are smaller than anticipated. We may not achieve revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, train, and retain talented and effective sales personnel. We depend on our sales force to obtain new customers and to drive additional sales to existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel, including sales representatives, sales managers, and sales engineers, with the requisite skills and technical knowledge. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient sales personnel to support our growth, and as we introduce new products, solutions and marketing strategies, we may need to re-train existing sales personnel. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. In addition, particularly as we continue to grow rapidly, a large percentage of our sales force will have relatively little experience working with us, our subscriptions, and our business model. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, our sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, or our sales and marketing programs are not effective, our growth and results of operations could be negatively impacted and our business will be harmed. Our ability to increase sales of our offerings is highly dependent on the quality of our customer support, and our failure to offer high quality support would have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. After our products are deployed within our customers\u2019 IT environments, our customers depend on our technical support services to resolve issues relating to our products. If we do not succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues or provide effective ongoing support and education on our products, our ability to sell additional subscriptions to existing customers or expand the value of existing customers\u2019 subscriptions would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. Many larger enterprise and government entity customers have more complex IT environments and require higher levels of support than smaller customers. If we fail to meet the requirements of these enterprise customers, it may be more difficult to grow sales with them. Additionally, it can take several months to recruit, hire, and train qualified technical support employees. We may not be able to hire such resources fast enough to keep up with demand, particularly if the sales of our offerings exceed our internal forecasts. Due to the ongoing uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, there may also be more competition for qualified employees and delays in hiring, onboarding and training new employees. To the extent that we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, and retaining adequate support resources, our ability to provide adequate and timely support to our customers, and our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our offerings, will be adversely affected. Our failure to provide and maintain, or a market perception that we do not provide or maintain, high-quality support services would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We rely significantly on revenue from subscriptions and, because we recognize a significant portion of the revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant subscription period, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our results of operations. Subscription revenue accounts for the substantial majority of our revenue, comprising 93%, 92% and 91% of total revenue in the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We recognize a significant portion of our subscription revenue monthly over the term of the relevant time period. As a result, much of the subscription revenue we report each fiscal quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from subscription contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our subscriptions is not reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods. A real or perceived defect, security vulnerability, error, or performance failure in our software could cause us to lose revenue, damage our reputation, and expose us to liability. Our products are inherently complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, have in the past and may in the future contain defects or errors, especially when first introduced, or otherwise not perform as contemplated. These defects, security vulnerabilities, errors or performance failures could cause damage to our reputation, loss of customers or revenue, product returns, order cancellations, service terminations, or lack of market acceptance of our software. As the use of our products, including products that were recently acquired or developed, expands to more sensitive, secure, or mission critical uses by our customers, we may be subject to increased scrutiny, potential reputational risk, or potential liability should our software fail to perform as contemplated in such deployments. We have in the past and may in the future need to issue corrective releases of our software to fix these defects, errors or performance failures, which could require us to allocate significant research and development and customer support resources to address these problems. Any limitation of liability provisions that may be contained in our customer and partner agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future applicable law or unfavorable judicial decisions. The sale and support of our products entail the risk of liability claims, which could be substantial in light of the use of our products in enterprise-wide environments. In addition, our insurance against this liability may not be adequate to cover a potential claim. Incorrect implementation or use of, or our customers\u2019 failure to update, our software could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our business, operations, financial results, and growth prospects. Our products are often operated in large scale, complex IT environments. Our customers and some partners require training and experience in the proper use of and the benefits that can be derived from our products to maximize their potential. If our products are not implemented, configured, updated or used correctly or as intended, or in a timely manner, inadequate performance, errors, loss of data, corruptions and/or security vulnerabilities may result. For example, there have been and may in the future continue to be, reports of our customers not properly securing implementations of our products, which can result in unprotected data. Because our customers rely on our software to manage a wide range of operations, the incorrect implementation, use of, or our customers\u2019 failure to update, our software or our failure to train customers on how to use our software productively may result in customer dissatisfaction, negative publicity and may adversely affect our reputation and brand. Failure by us to effectively provide training and implementation services to our customers could result in lost opportunities for follow-on sales to these customers and decrease subscriptions by new customers, and adversely affect our business and growth prospects. If third parties offer inadequate or defective implementations of software that we have previously made available under an open source license, our reputation could be harmed. Certain cloud hosting providers and managed service providers, including Amazon Web Services, offer SaaS products based on older Elastic Stack releases, using the names of our products in marketing such offerings. These offerings are not supported by us and come without any of our proprietary features. We do not control how these third parties may use or offer our open source technology. These third parties could inadequately or incorrectly implement our open source technology, or fail to update such technology in light of changing technological or security requirements, which could result in real or perceived defects, security vulnerabilities, errors, or performance failures with respect to their offerings. Users, customers, and potential customers could confuse these third-party products with our products, and attribute such defects, security vulnerabilities, errors, or performance failures to our products. Any damage to our reputation and brand from defective implementations of our open source software could result in lost sales and lack of market acceptance of our products and could adversely affect our business and growth prospects. We rely on traditional web search engines to direct traffic to our website. If our website fails to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our website could decline and our business would be adversely affected. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract users through unpaid Internet search results on traditional web search engines, such as Google. The number of users we attract to our website from search engines is due in large part to how and where our website ranks in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not in our direct control, and they may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to influence the results. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website could reduce our revenue or require us to increase our customer acquisition expenditures. If our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to private or proprietary data is otherwise obtained, our software may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our products, and we may incur significant liabilities. Any security breach, including those resulting from a cybersecurity attack, phishing attack, or any unauthorized access, unauthorized usage, virus, malware, ransomware or similar breach or disruption to our networks and systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, could result in the loss of confidential information, damage to our reputation, litigation, regulatory investigations or other liabilities. These attacks may come from individual hackers, criminal groups, and state-sponsored organizations. Cyber threats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. As a provider of security solutions, we may be specifically targeted by bad actors for attacks intended to circumvent our security capabilities as an entry point into customers\u2019 endpoints, networks, or systems. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, defect or bug in our products, malfeasance or otherwise and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to our confidential information or personal information or the confidential information or personal information of our customers, our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Even the perception of inadequate security may damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers. Further, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address any data security incident or breach. In addition, many of our customers may use our software for processing their sensitive and proprietary information, including business strategies, financial and operational data, personal or identifying information and other related data. As a result, unauthorized access or use of this data could result in the loss, compromise, corruption or destruction of our customers\u2019 sensitive and proprietary information and lead to litigation, regulatory investigations and claims, indemnity obligations, and other liabilities. It could also hinder our ability to obtain and maintain information security certifications that support customers\u2019 adoption of our products and our retention of those customers. We have implemented administrative, technical and physical measures designed to protect the integrity of customer information and prevent data loss, misappropriation and other security breaches and incidents and may incur significant costs in connection with the implementation of additional preventative measures in the future. We engage third-party vendors and service providers to store and otherwise process some of our and our customers\u2019 data, including sensitive and personal information. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain cyber attacks generally, and our third-party vendors and service providers may be targeted or impacted by such attacks. We cannot guarantee that our or our third-party vendors and service providers\u2019 systems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our services. Our ability to monitor our third-party vendors and service providers\u2019 data security is limited, and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures, resulting in the unauthorized access to, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of our and our customers\u2019 data, including sensitive and personal information. Techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems or networks are constantly evolving and, in some instances, are not identified until launched against a target. We and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative measures. Security risks are also heightened during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as more individuals are working remotely and utilizing home networks for transmitting information, and reported ransomware incidents with significant operational impacts also appear to be escalating in frequency and degree. In addition, laws, regulations, government guidance, and industry standards and practices in the United States and elsewhere are rapidly evolving to combat these threats. We may face increased compliance burdens regarding such requirements with regulators and customers regarding our products and services and also incur additional costs for oversight and monitoring of our own supply chain. We and our customers may also experience increased costs associated with security measures and increased risk of suffering cyberattacks, including ransomware. Should we or the third-party vendors upon which we rely experience such attacks, including from ransomware, our operations may also be hindered or interrupted, with foreseeable secondary contractual, regulatory, financial, and reputational harms that may arise from such an incident. Further, we cannot assure that any limitations of liability provisions in our customer and user agreements, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers or other contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security-related matter. We also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover claims related to a security incident or breach, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation. Interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure, and our reliance on technologies from third parties, may adversely affect our business operations and financial results. We rely on third-party cloud platforms to host our cloud offerings. If we experience an interruption in service for any reason, our cloud offerings would similarly be interrupted. An interruption in our services to our customers could cause our customers\u2019 internal and consumer-facing applications to not function properly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, customer relationships and reputation. In addition, our website and internal technology infrastructure may experience performance issues due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website or third-party hosting disruptions, capacity constraints, technical failures, natural disasters or fraud or security attacks. Our use of third-party open source software may increase this risk. If our website is unavailable or our users are unable to download our products or order subscriptions or services within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business could be harmed. We expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve website performance and to enable rapid releases of new features and applications for our products. To the extent that we do not effectively upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We rely on third-party service providers for many aspects of our business, and any failure to maintain these relationships could harm our business. Our success depends upon our relationships with third-party service providers, including providers of cloud hosting infrastructure, customer relationship management systems, financial reporting systems, human resource management systems, credit card processing platforms, marketing automation systems, and payroll processing systems, among others. If any of these third parties experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards, become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions, temporarily or permanently cease operations, face financial distress or other business disruptions, increase their fees, if our relationships with any of these providers deteriorate, or if any of the agreements we have entered into with such third parties are terminated or not renewed without adequate transition arrangements, we could suffer liabilities, penalties, fines, increased costs and delays in our ability to provide customers with our products and services, our ability to manage our finances could be interrupted, receipt of payments from customers may be delayed, our processes for managing sales of our offerings could be impaired, our ability to generate and manage sales leads could be weakened, or our business operations could be disrupted. Any of such disruptions may adversely impact our business and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected until we replace such providers or develop replacement technology or operations. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in identifying high-quality service providers, negotiating cost-effective relationships with them or effectively managing these relationships, it could adversely affect our business and financial results. The length of our sales cycle can be unpredictable, particularly with respect to sales through our channel partners or sales to large customers, and our sales efforts may require considerable time and expense. Our results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the length and variability of the sales cycle of our subscriptions and the difficulty in making short-term adjustments to our operating expenses. Our results of operations depend in part on sales to new customers, including large customers, and increasing sales to existing customers. The length of our sales cycle, from initial contact with our sales team to contractually committing to our subscriptions can vary substantially from customer to customer based on deal complexity as well as whether a sale is made directly by us or through a channel partner. Our sales cycle can extend to more than a year for some customers, and the length of sales cycles may be further impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some customers have been scrutinizing their spending more carefully given a challenging economic environment associated with the pandemic, and we generally expect this to continue. This might cause sales cycles to become longer or become more unpredictable. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. A customer\u2019s decision to use our solutions may be an enterprise-wide decision, which may require greater levels of education regarding the use cases of our products or prolonged negotiations. In addition, larger customers may demand more configuration, integration services and features. It is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale to a potential customer or if we can increase sales to our existing customers. As a result, large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or delay of one or more large transactions in a quarter could affect our cash flows and results of operations for that quarter and for future quarters. Because a substantial proportion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our cash flows and results of operations will suffer if revenue falls below our expectations in a particular quarter, which could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline. We depend on our senior management and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could harm our business. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales, may seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, our ability to attract additional qualified personnel may be impacted by the economic uncertainty and insecurity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The loss of services of any of our key personnel also increases our dependency on other key personnel who remain with us. Although we have entered into employment offer letters with our key personnel, their employment is for no specific duration and constitutes at-will employment. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing engineering personnel because of the complexity of our products. Our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Shay Banon, to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of services of senior management could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any search for senior management in the future or any search to replace the loss of any senior management may be prolonged, and we may not be able to attract a qualified candidate or replacement, as applicable, in a timely manner or at all, particularly as potential candidates may be wary to transition during the unstable economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic could make it more difficult to onboard, provide training to and integrate any senior management or key employees, which could adversely affect their productivity and our business. If we are unable to mitigate these or other similar risks as we experience management turnover, our business, results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected. Additionally, the industry in which we operate is generally characterized by significant competition for skilled personnel as well as high employee attrition. We may not be successful in attracting, integrating, or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. Also, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited, that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product. If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, especially among developers, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our business and operating results may be adversely affected. We believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand, especially with developers, is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our software and attracting new users and customers. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successfully maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our ability to maintain our customers\u2019 trust, our ability to continue to develop new functionality and use cases, and our ability to successfully differentiate our products and platform capability from competitive products. Brand promotion activities may not generate user or customer awareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. For instance, our continued focus and investment in ElasticON and similar investments in our brand, user engagement, and customer engagement may not generate the desired customer awareness or a sufficient financial return. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract or retain users and customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our products, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit we have worked to foster, which could harm our business. We believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. We expect to continue to hire as we expand. If we do not continue to maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit we believe we need to support our growth. Moreover, many of our existing employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our ordinary shares in the public markets, which could lead to employee attrition and disparities of wealth among our employees that adversely affects relations among employees and our culture in general. Additional headcount growth may result in a change to our corporate culture, which could harm our business. We rely on channel partners to execute a portion of our sales; if our channel partners fail to perform or we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners, our ability to market, sell and distribute our solution will be more limited, and our results of operations could be harmed. A portion of our revenue is generated by sales through our channel partners, especially to U.S. federal government customers and in certain international markets, and these sales may grow and represent a larger portion of our revenues in the future. We provide certain of our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our offerings, but there can be no assurance that these steps will be effective. In addition, our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing and selling our offerings, particularly in light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners, we may not be able to incentivize these partners to sell our offerings to customers. Some of these partners may also market, sell, and support offerings that compete with ours, may devote more resources to the marketing, sales, and support of such competitive offerings, may have incentives to promote our competitors\u2019 offerings to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our offerings altogether. Our agreements with our channel partners typically have a duration of one to three years, and generally may be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice prior to each renewal date. We may not be able to retain these channel partners or secure additional or replacement channel partners. The loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or a decline in the number or size of orders from any of them could harm our results of operations. In addition, many of our new channel partners require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity. Our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability, and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresents the functionality of our offerings to customers or violates laws or our or their corporate policies. If our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our offerings, or if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain high quality channel partners, our ability to sell our offerings and results of operations could be harmed. If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our partners, our business operations, financial results and growth prospects could be adversely affected. We maintain partnership relationships with a variety of partners, including cloud providers, systems integrators, channel partners, referral partners, OEM and MSP partners, and technology partners, to deliver offerings to our end customers and complement our broad community of users. In particular, we partner with various cloud providers to jointly market, sell and deliver our Elastic Cloud offerings, and in some instances this also involves technical integration with such cloud providers. Our agreements with our partners are generally non-exclusive, meaning our partners may offer customers the offerings of several different companies, including offerings that compete with ours, or may themselves be or become competitors. If our partners do not effectively market and sell our offerings, choose to use greater efforts to market and sell their own offerings or those of our competitors, fail to meet the needs of our customers, or fail to deliver professional services to our customers particularly in light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to grow our business and sell our offerings may be harmed. Our partners may cease marketing our offerings with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. The loss of a substantial number of our partners, our possible inability to replace them, or the failure to recruit additional partners could harm our results of operations. Our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our partners and in helping our partners enhance their ability to market and sell our subscriptions. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these partners, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be harmed. The sales prices of our offerings may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our financial results. The sales prices for our offerings may decline or we may introduce new pricing models for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, in anticipation of or in conjunction with the introduction of new offerings, or promotional programs. Competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we operate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Larger competitors with more diverse offerings may reduce the price of offerings that compete with ours or may bundle them with other offerings. Additionally, currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that customers and channel partners are willing to pay in those countries and regions. Any decrease in the sales prices for our offerings, without a corresponding decrease in costs or increase in volume, would adversely impact our gross profit. Gross profit could also be adversely impacted by a shift in the mix of our subscriptions from self-managed to our cloud offering, for which we incur hosting costs, as well as any increase in our mix of professional services relative to subscriptions. We may not be able to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to achieve and maintain profitability. We expect our revenue mix to vary over time, which could harm our gross margin and operating results. We expect our revenue mix to vary over time due to a number of factors, and we expect that revenue from Elastic Cloud will continue to become a larger part of our revenue mix. Due to the differing revenue recognition policies applicable to our subscriptions and professional services, shifts in our business mix from quarter to quarter could produce substantial variation in revenue recognized. Further, our gross margins and operating results could be harmed by changes in revenue mix and costs, together with numerous other factors, including entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets; entry into markets with different pricing and cost structures; pricing discounts; and increased price competition. Any one of these factors or the cumulative effects of certain of these factors may result in significant fluctuations in our gross margin and operating results. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet internal expectations or those of securities analysts or investors for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline. Failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and results of operations. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, methodologies, know-how and brand. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patents, contractual restrictions, and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property rights if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights. The source code of the proprietary features for the Elastic Stack is publicly available, which may enable others to replicate our proprietary technology and compete more effectively. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our proprietary technology and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights that we have or may obtain may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. As of April 30, 2021, we had 24 issued U.S. patents, 57 pending U.S. patent applications, and 17 pending non-U.S. filings. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents. Even if we continue to seek patent protection in the future, we may be unable to obtain further patent protection for our technology. In addition, any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create offerings that compete with ours. Effective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products are available. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. The laws of some countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information will likely increase. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other parties. No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products. In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. For example, on September 4, 2019, we filed suit against floragunn GmbH in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for copyright infringement and contributory copyright infringement, and on September 27, 2019, we filed a suit against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for trademark infringement and false advertising. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Further, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our products, impair the functionality of our products, delay introductions of new products, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our products, or injure our reputation. We could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement, misappropriation or violation of another party\u2019s intellectual property rights. In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the software industry. Companies providing software are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement, misappropriation or violation of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights, and to the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation claims. We do not currently have a large patent portfolio, which could prevent us from deterring patent infringement claims through our own patent portfolio, and our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. The risk of patent litigation has been amplified by the increase in the number of a type of patent holder, which we refer to as a non-practicing entity, whose sole or principal business is to assert such claims and against whom our own intellectual property portfolio may provide little deterrent value. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending any intellectual property litigation. If we sue to enforce our rights or are sued by a third party that claims that our products infringe, misappropriate or violate their rights, the litigation could be expensive and could divert our management resources. Any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following: \u2022cease selling or using products that incorporate the intellectual property rights that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate or violate; \u2022make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages; \u2022obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to sell or use the relevant technology; or \u2022redesign the allegedly infringing products to avoid infringement, misappropriation or violation, which could be costly, time-consuming or impossible. If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims, such payments or actions could harm our business. Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, violation and other losses. Our agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our software, services or other contractual obligations. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such indemnity obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business and results of operations. Our use of third-party open source software within our products could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation. Our technologies incorporate open source software from other developers, and we expect to continue to incorporate such open source software in our products in the future. Few of the licenses applicable to open source software have been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Moreover, we cannot assure that we have not incorporated third-party open source software in our software in a manner that is inconsistent with the terms of the applicable license or our current policies and procedures. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain requirements, including requirements that we offer our solutions that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of applicable open source licenses. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our products that contained the open source software and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these products, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of these products. In addition, there have been claims challenging the ownership rights in open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products, and the licensors of such open source software provide no warranties or indemnities with respect to such claims. In any of these events, we and our customers could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, and to re-engineer our products or discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis. We and our customers may also be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or violation due to the reliance by our solutions on certain open source software, and such litigation could be costly for us to defend or subject us to an injunction. Some open source projects have known vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities and as provided on an \u201cas-is\u201d basis which, if not properly addressed, could negatively affect the performance of our product. Any of the foregoing could require us to devote additional research and development resources to re-engineer our solutions, could result in customer dissatisfaction, and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. One of our marketing strategies is to offer some of our product features for free and to provide free trials of some of our paid features, and we may not be able to realize the benefits of this strategy. We are dependent upon lead generation strategies, including offering free use of some of our product features and free trials of some of our paid features. These strategies may not be successful in continuing to generate sufficient sales opportunities necessary to increase our revenue. Many users never convert from the free use model or from free trials to the paid versions of our products. To the extent that users do not become, or we are unable to successfully attract, paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of these marketing strategies and our ability to grow our revenue will be adversely affected. With the acquisition of Endgame, we face risks related to the integration of combined businesses, our cash resources and financial results, undisclosed liabilities, and employee and customer retention. Since the closing of the acquisition of Endgame in October 2019, we have devoted significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the former Endgame business with our business. Potential difficulties we may encounter as we continue to integrate Endgame into our business strategy include those related to the costs of integration and compliance, diversion of management\u2019s attention, our ability to create and enforce uniform standards, procedures, policies and information systems, potential unknown liabilities, and unforeseen increased expenses or delays. Our due diligence review in connection with the acquisition may not have discovered undisclosed liabilities of Endgame. If there are undisclosed liabilities, Elastic as a successor owner may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities. Such undisclosed liabilities could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations and may adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares. The acquisition may also result in significant charges or other liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations, such as cash expenses and non-cash accounting charges incurred in connection with the acquisition and/or integration of the combined businesses and operations. Our international operations and expansion expose us to several risks. As of April 30, 2021, we had customers located in over 100 countries, and our strategy is to continue to expand internationally. In addition, as a result of our strategy of leveraging a distributed workforce, as of April 30, 2021, we had employees located in over 35 countries. Our current international operations involve and future initiatives may involve a variety of risks, including: \u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions; \u2022different labor regulations, especially in the European Union, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations; \u2022exposure to many stringent, particularly in the European Union, and potentially inconsistent laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security; \u2022changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions; \u2022political, economic and trade uncertainties or instability related to the effect of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), including the effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union, the European Atomic Energy Community and the United Kingdom signed in December 2020, on the economies of, and the relationships between, the United Kingdom, European Union, United States and other countries; \u2022the evolving relations between the United States and China; \u2022changes in relations between the Netherlands and the United States; \u2022risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates and inflation; \u2022the impact of public health epidemics or pandemics on our employees, partners and customers; \u2022challenges inherent to efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs; \u2022risks relating to the implementation of trade and economic sanctions, including restrictions promulgated by the OFAC, and other similar trade protection regulations and measures in the United States or in other jurisdictions; \u2022risks relating to our third-party vendors and service providers\u2019 storage and processing of some of our and our customers\u2019 data, including any supply chain cyber attacks; \u2022reduced ability to timely collect amounts owed to us by our customers in countries where our recourse may be more limited; \u2022limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations derived from one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries; \u2022limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection; and \u2022exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and similar applicable laws and regulations in other jurisdictions. If we are unable to address these difficulties and challenges or other problems encountered in connection with our international operations and expansion, we might incur unanticipated liabilities or we might otherwise suffer harm to our business generally. If we are not successful in sustaining and expanding our international business, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be harmed. Our future results depend, in part, on our ability to sustain and expand our penetration of the international markets in which we currently operate and to expand into additional international markets. We depend on direct sales and our channel partner relationships to sell our offerings in international markets. Our ability to expand internationally will depend upon our ability to deliver functionality and foreign language translations that reflect the needs of the international clients that we target. Our ability to expand internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in such expansion, and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future or at all in these less familiar competitive environments. We may also choose to conduct our international business through other partnerships. If we are unable to identify partners or negotiate favorable terms, our international growth may be limited. In addition, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses in advance of generating material revenue as we attempt to establish our presence in particular international markets. If we need to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new offerings, it could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business. We may need to raise additional funds in the future, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity financing, our shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our ordinary shares could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in debt financing, the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of our ordinary shares, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. We may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things: \u2022develop or enhance our products; \u2022continue to expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations; \u2022acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses; \u2022expand operations in the United States or internationally; \u2022hire, train, and retain employees; or \u2022respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements. Our failure to have sufficient capital to do any of these things could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. A portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks. Sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. Government certification requirements for products like ours may change, thereby restricting our ability to sell into the U.S. federal government sector, U.S. state government sector, or government sectors of countries other than the United States until we have attained the revised certification. For example, we hold a U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program Authority to Operate at a moderate impact level; however, such authority is costly to maintain and if we were to lose our certification in the future, it would restrict our ability to sell to government customers. On May 12, 2021, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order that will ultimately result in additional security requirements for government agencies and their contractors, for example, multifactor authentication, encryption for data at rest and in transit, and broad log creation, preservation, and production requirements. Furthermore, the Executive Order accelerates agency planning and implementation requirements for \u201czero trust architecture\u201d and will establish a standards-development effort for a software bill of materials. This may increase compliance costs directly for government contracts and indirectly to the extent such requirements require changes or new efforts at an enterprise level. If we are unable to timely meet such requirements, our ability to compete for and maintain federal government contracts may be diminished, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Government demand and payment for our offerings may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our offerings. Sales to government agencies, including classified contracts, are subject to complex regulations. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in contract terminations or other adverse consequences, including but not limited to adversely affecting our eligibility to sell to government agencies in the future. Additionally, we rely on certain partners to provide technical support services to certain of our government entity customers to resolve any issues relating to our products. If our partners do not effectively assist our government entity customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our government entity customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, or provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional offerings to new and existing government entity customers would be adversely affected and our reputation could be damaged. Government entities may have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with us or our channel partners for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely affect our future results of operations. In addition, multi-year contracts with government entities are usually conditioned on annual fiscal funding actions that the relevant legislative or other decision-making body must take in order to fund each year of a contract. Such legislative or decision-making bodies may elect not to fund each year of a contract. Governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors\u2019 administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our subscriptions, a reduction of revenue, or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, which could adversely affect our results of operations in a material way. Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the Netherlands, the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to change and interpretation, and certain jurisdictions may aggressively interpret their laws in an effort to raise additional tax revenue. For example, recently, in the United States, the Biden administration has proposed a number of changes, including an increase to the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%. In addition, other countries, as well as organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could impact our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business. Any new legislation or interpretations of existing legislation could result in increased taxation of our international earnings. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. Tax authorities examine and may audit our income tax returns and other non-income tax returns, such as payroll, sales, value-added, net worth or franchise, property, goods and services, and excise taxes, in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. Further, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our results of operations. Based on our current corporate structure, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents. In addition, the authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate could review our tax returns or require us to file tax returns in jurisdictions in which we are not currently filing, and could impose additional tax, interest and penalties. These authorities could also claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries, assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, or challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing. The relevant taxing authorities may determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences. If such a disagreement was to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, and interest and penalties. Any increase in the amount of taxes we pay or that are imposed on us could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business and results of operations. Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. As of April 30, 2021 and 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards in various jurisdictions of $2.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, which may be utilized against future income taxes. Limitations imposed by the applicable jurisdictions on our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards could cause income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating loss carryforwards to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our net operating loss carryforwards. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. A portion of our subscriptions are generated and operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly against the Euro. In part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign currency exchange rates have been and could continue to be subject to increased volatility. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar increases the real cost of our offerings to our customers outside of the United States, leading to delays in the purchase of our offerings and the lengthening of our sales cycle. If the strength of the U.S. dollar increases, this could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased international sales in the future, including through our channel partners, may result in greater foreign currency denominated sales, increasing our foreign currency risk. Moreover, operating expenses incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our sales and results of operations. Historically, we have experienced quarterly fluctuations and seasonality based on the timing of entering into agreements with new and existing customers and the mix between annual and monthly contracts entered in each reporting period. Trends in our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by seasonality in our sales cycle which generally reflects a trend to greater sales in our second and fourth quarters and lower sales in our first and third quarters, though we believe this trend has been somewhat masked by our overall growth. We expect that this seasonality will continue to affect our results of operations in the future, and might become more pronounced as we continue to target larger enterprise customers. Risks Related to Regulatory Matters In connection with the operation of our business, we may collect, store, transfer and otherwise process certain personal data. As a result, our business is subject to a variety of government and industry regulations, as well as other obligations, related to privacy, data protection and information security. Privacy, data protection and information security have become significant issues in various jurisdictions where we offer our products. The regulatory frameworks for these issues worldwide are rapidly evolving and are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Federal, state, or non-U.S. government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, new laws and regulations or may make amendments to existing laws and regulations affecting data protection, data privacy and/or information security and/or regulating the use of the Internet as a commercial medium. For example, the recently enacted California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) provides new data privacy rights for California residents. The enforcement of the CCPA by the California Attorney General commenced July 1, 2020. We cannot fully predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or operations, but we may be required to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in connection with our compliance or the compliance of our customers or vendors. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for violations, which may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), was approved by California voters in the November 3, 2020 election. The CPRA creates obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. We will continue to monitor developments related to the CPRA and anticipate additional costs and expenses associated with CPRA compliance. Other U.S. states also are considering omnibus privacy legislation and industry organizations regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these areas. Many obligations under the CCPA and these other laws and legislative proposals remain uncertain, and we cannot fully predict their impact on our business. If we fail to comply with any of these laws or standards, we may be subject to investigations, enforcement actions, civil litigation, fines and other penalties, all of which may generate negative publicity and have a negative impact on our business. Additionally, in the United States, we may be subject to investigation and/or enforcement actions brought by federal agencies and state attorneys general and consumer protection agencies. We publicly post statements and other documentation regarding our practices concerning the processing, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information. Although we endeavor to comply with our published statements and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy statement and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices. Internationally, most jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own privacy, data protection and information security legal frameworks with which we or our customers must comply. Within the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) became fully effective on May 25, 2018, and applies to the processing (which includes the collection and use) of personal data. The GDPR imposes significant obligations and risk upon our business and provides for substantial penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. Administrative fines under the GDPR can amount up to 20 million Euros or four percent of the group\u2019s annual global turnover, whichever is higher. Further, the United Kingdom has implemented legislation that substantially implements the GDPR in the United Kingdom, which legislation provides for penalties for violations of up to the greater of 17.5 million British pounds or four percent of the group\u2019s annual global turnover. Following the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union however, aspects of U.K. data protection law and the relationship of the United Kingdom and the European Union in the medium to longer term remain unclear, including with respect to how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated. We have incurred substantial expense in complying with new data protection legal frameworks and we may be required to make additional, significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenue and our business overall. Additionally, because these new regimes lack a substantial enforcement history, we are unable to predict how emerging standards may be applied to us. Despite our efforts to attempt to comply with new data protection obligations, a regulator may determine that we have not done so and subject us to fines and public censure, which could harm our company. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States. Some countries also are considering or have passed legislation requiring local storage and processing of data, or similar requirements, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. We have undertaken certain efforts to conform transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), to the United States and other jurisdictions based on our understanding of current regulatory obligations and the guidance of data protection authorities, including standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission (the \u201cSCCs\u201d). Despite this, we may be unsuccessful in maintaining conforming means of transferring such data from the EEA, in particular as a result of continued legal and legislative activity within the EEA that has challenged or called into question existing means of data transfers to countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection for personal data. The regulatory environment applicable to handling of EEA residents' personal data, and our actions taken in response, may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs. In the Schrems II decision issued by the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) on July 16, 2020, the CJEU, among other things, imposed additional obligations on companies when relying on the SCCs. We and our customers may face EEA regulators applying different standards to certain data transfers or requiring additional steps in connection with data transfers, and may be required to engage in new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf. We may be unsuccessful in maintaining legitimate means for our transfer and receipt of personal data from the EEA, and may experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national customers to continue to use our products due to the potential risk exposure to such customers as a result of sentiment in the EEA regarding international data transfers and data protection obligations imposed on them. We may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain personal data originating from the EEA in the EEA, or may need to take other steps with respect to data handling and data transfers, including means to provide for local data processing, which may involve substantial expense and may require us to divert resources from other aspects of our business, all of which may adversely affect our business. We and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by European data protection authorities until the time, if any, that personal data transfers to us and by us from the EEA are legitimized under European law. These and the other risks described above could result in harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that may legally or contractually apply to us. One example of such a self-regulatory standard is the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d), which relates to the processing of payment card information. In the event we or our payment processors fail to comply with the PCI DSS, fines and other penalties could result, and we may suffer reputational harm and damage to our business. Further, our customers increasingly expect us to comply with more stringent privacy, data protection and information security requirements than those imposed by laws, regulations or self-regulatory requirements, and we may be obligated contractually to comply with additional or different standards relating to our handling or protection of data on or by our offerings. Any failure to meet our customers\u2019 requirements may adversely affect our revenues and prospects for growth. We also expect that there will continue to be changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or new proposed laws, regulations, and other obligations concerning privacy, data protection and information security, which could impair our or our customers\u2019 ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to consumers, which could decrease demand for our offerings, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. Because the interpretation and application of many laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, along with industry standards, are uncertain, it is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in manners that are, or are alleged to be, inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products, and we could face fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations and other claims and penalties, and we could be required to fundamentally change our products or our business practices, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy, data protection and information security concerns, even if unfounded, or any actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy, data protection or information security laws, regulations and other obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our products. Privacy, data protection and information security concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our products, particularly in certain industries and countries outside of the United States. If we are not able to adjust to changing laws, regulations and standards related to the Internet, our business may be harmed. We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions programs that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls. Our software and services, in some cases, are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations including the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), and trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). As such, an export license may be required to export or reexport our software and services to certain countries and end-users for certain end-uses. If we were to fail to comply with such U.S. export controls laws and regulations, U.S. economic sanctions, or other similar laws, we could be subject to both civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration for employees and managers for willful violations, and the possible loss of our export or import privileges. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale or offering may not be possible and may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions in many cases prohibit the export of software and services to certain U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons, as well as for prohibited end-uses. Monitoring and ensuring compliance with these complex U.S. export control laws is particularly challenging because our offerings are widely distributed throughout the world, and information available on the users of these offerings is, in some cases, limited. In addition, because we incorporate encryption functionality into our products, we are also subject to certain provisions of these laws that apply to encryption items. Even though we take precautions to ensure that we and our partners comply with all relevant export control laws and regulations, any failure by us or our partners to comply with such laws and regulations could have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties. In addition, various countries regulate the export and import of certain encryption software and technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products and services or could limit our end-customers\u2019 ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations in such countries may create delays in the introduction of our products and services into international markets, prevent our end-customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent or delay the export or import of our products and services to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. The following developments could result in decreased use of our products and services by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations: any change in export or import laws or regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation; shift in the enforcement or scope of existing export, import or sanctions laws or regulations; or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such export, import or sanctions laws or regulations. Any decreased use of our products or services or limitation on our ability to export to or sell our products or services in international markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions both domestic and abroad. We leverage channel partners to sell our offerings abroad and use other third parties, including recruiting firms, professional employer organizations, legal, accounting and other professional advisors, and local vendors to meet our needs associated with doing business abroad. We and these third parties may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies, or state-owned or affiliated entities, and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our channel partners and third-party representatives, as well as our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that the channel partners, third-party representatives, our employees, contractors or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Any violation of the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects. Risks Related to Ownership of our Ordinary Shares The market price for our ordinary shares has been and is likely to continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance. The stock markets, and securities of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. The economic impact and uncertainty of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated this volatility in both the overall stock markets and the market price of our ordinary shares. In the past, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business. The market price of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: \u2022actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our operating results; \u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; \u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new offerings or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments; \u2022industry or financial analyst or investor reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC; \u2022rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; \u2022a gain or loss of investor confidence in the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general; \u2022future sales or expected future sales of our ordinary shares; \u2022investor perceptions of us, the benefits of our offerings and the industries in which we operate; \u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time; \u2022changes in operating performance and/or stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular; \u2022failure of industry or financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; \u2022actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally; \u2022litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors; \u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights; \u2022announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors; \u2022breaches of, or failures relating to, privacy, data protection or information security; \u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; \u2022any major changes in our management or our board of directors, particularly with respect to Mr. Banon; \u2022general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and \u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events. We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline. We have provided and may continue to provide guidance and other expectations in our quarterly and annual earnings conference calls, quarterly and annual earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future performance. Guidance, as well as other expectations, are forward-looking and represent our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release and are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies on our business, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. One of those key assumptions relates to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the associated economic uncertainty on our business, which is inherently difficult to predict. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business, which may form a consensus about our future performance. Our actual business results may vary significantly from such guidance or other expectations or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including due to the global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and which could adversely affect our business and future operating results. There are no comparable recent events that provide insights as to the probable effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. Furthermore, if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance or other expectations, if we withdraw our previously announced guidance or other expectations, or if our publicly announced guidance or other expectations of future operating results fail to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our ordinary shares would decline. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance or other expectations in making an investment decision regarding our ordinary shares. Any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in this report could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance or other expectations, and the differences may be adverse and material. The concentration of our share ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including the ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring shareholder approval. Our executive officers and directors together beneficially owned 20.7% of our ordinary shares outstanding as of April 30, 2021. As a result, these shareholders, acting together, will have significant influence over matters that require approval by our shareholders, including matters such as adoption of the financial statements, declarations of dividends, the appointment and dismissal of directors, capital increases, amendment to our articles of association and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate action might be taken even if other shareholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us that other shareholders may view as beneficial. The issuance of additional shares in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our share incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other shareholders. Our articles of association authorize us to issue up to 165 million ordinary shares and up to 165 million preference shares with such rights and preferences as included in our articles of association. On September 28, 2018, our extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the \u201c2018 Extraordinary Meeting\u201d) empowered our board of directors to issue ordinary shares and preference shares up to our authorized share capital for a period of five years from October 10, 2018. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue ordinary shares or securities convertible into ordinary shares from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our share incentive plans or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders unless pre-emptive rights exist and cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline. Certain holders of our ordinary shares may not be able to exercise pre-emptive rights and as a result may experience substantial dilution upon future issuances of ordinary shares. Holders of our ordinary shares in principle have a pro rata pre-emptive right with respect to any issue of ordinary shares or the granting of rights to subscribe for ordinary shares, unless Dutch law or our articles of association state otherwise or unless explicitly provided otherwise in a resolution by our general meeting of shareholders (the \u201cGeneral Meeting\u201d), or-if authorized by the annual General Meeting or an extraordinary General Meeting-by a resolution of our board of directors. Our 2018 Extraordinary Meeting has empowered our board of directors to limit or exclude pre-emptive rights on ordinary shares for a period of five years from October 10, 2018, which could cause existing shareholders to experience substantial dilution of their interest in us. Pre-emptive rights do not exist with respect to the issue of preference shares and holders of preference shares, if any, have no pre-emptive right to acquire newly issued ordinary shares. Also, pre-emptive rights do not exist with respect to the issue of shares or grant of rights to subscribe for shares to employees of the company or contributions in kind. Sales of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our ordinary shares might otherwise attain. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our ordinary shares in the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares and may make it more difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares at a time and price that you deem appropriate. In addition, holders of an aggregate of 18,138,691 ordinary shares, based on shares outstanding as of April 30, 2021, are entitled to rights with respect to registration of these shares under the Securities Act pursuant to our amended and restated investors\u2019 rights agreement, dated July 19, 2016. If these holders of our ordinary shares, by exercising their registration rights, sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price for our ordinary shares. We have also filed registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering all ordinary shares that we may issue under our equity compensation plan, which may in turn be sold and may adversely affect the market price for our ordinary shares. Certain anti-takeover provisions in our articles of association and under Dutch law may prevent or could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors and may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. Our articles of association contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for shareholders to appoint directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include: \u2022the staggered three-year terms of the members of our board of directors, as a result of which only approximately one-third of the members of our board of directors may be subject to election in any one year; \u2022a provision that the members of our board of directors may only be removed by a General Meeting by a two-thirds majority of votes cast representing at least 50% of our issued share capital if such removal is not proposed by our board of directors; \u2022a provision that the members of our board of directors may only be appointed upon binding nomination of the board of directors, which can only be overruled with a two-thirds majority of votes cast representing at least 50% of our issued share capital; \u2022the inclusion of a class of preference shares in our authorized share capital that may be issued by our board of directors, in such a manner as to dilute the interest of shareholders, including any potential acquirer or activist shareholder, in order to delay or discourage any potential unsolicited offer or shareholder activism; \u2022requirements that certain matters, including an amendment of our articles of association, may only be brought to our shareholders for a vote upon a proposal by our board of directors; and \u2022minimum shareholding thresholds, based on nominal value, for shareholders to call General Meetings of our shareholders or to add items to the agenda for those meetings. We are subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code but do not comply with all the suggested governance provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. This may affect your rights as a shareholder. As a Dutch company, we are subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (\u201cDCGC\u201d). The DCGC contains both principles and suggested governance provisions for management boards, supervisory boards, shareholders and general meetings, financial reporting, auditors, disclosure, compliance and enforcement standards. The DCGC is based on a \u201ccomply or explain\u201d principle. Accordingly, public companies are required to disclose in their annual reports, filed in the Netherlands, whether they comply with the suggested governance provisions of the DCGC. If they do not comply with those provisions (e.g., because of a conflicting requirement), the company is required to give the reasons for such noncompliance. The DCGC applies to all Dutch companies listed on a government-recognized stock exchange, whether in the Netherlands or elsewhere, including the NYSE. The principles and suggested governance provisions apply to our board of directors (in relation to role and composition, conflicts of interest and independency requirements, board committees and remuneration), shareholders and the General Meeting (for example, regarding anti-takeover protection and our obligations to provide information to our shareholders) and financial reporting (such as external auditor and internal audit requirements). We comply with all applicable provisions of the DCGC except where such provisions conflict with U.S. exchange listing requirements or with market practices in the United States or the Netherlands. This may affect your rights as a shareholder, and you may not have the same level of protection as a shareholder in a Dutch company that fully complies with the suggested governance provisions of the DCGC. We do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our ordinary shares. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our shares. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. Were this position to change, payment of future dividends may be made only if our equity exceeds the amount of the paid-in and called-up part of the issued share capital, increased by the reserves required to be maintained by Dutch law or by our articles of association. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their ordinary shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. Claims of U.S. civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us. We are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and substantial portions of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, two members of our board of directors and certain experts named herein reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such persons in U.S. courts in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws. There is no treaty between the United States and the Netherlands for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands unless the underlying claim is re-litigated before a Dutch court of competent jurisdiction. In such proceedings, however, a Dutch court may be expected to recognize the binding effect of a judgment of a federal or state court in the United States without re-examination of the substantive matters adjudicated thereby, if (i) the jurisdiction of the U.S. federal or state court has been based on internationally accepted principles of private international law, (ii) that judgment resulted from legal proceedings compatible with Dutch notions of due process, (iii) that judgment does not contravene public policy of the Netherlands and (iv) that judgment is not incompatible with (x) an earlier judgment of a Dutch court between the same parties, or (y) an earlier judgment of a foreign court between the same parties in a dispute regarding the same subject and based on the same cause, if that earlier foreign judgment is recognizable in the Netherlands. Based on the foregoing, there can be no assurance that U.S. investors will be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors, officers or certain experts named herein, who are residents of the Netherlands or countries other than the United States, any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, there can be no assurance that a Dutch court would impose civil liability on us, the members of our board of directors, our officers or certain experts named herein in an original action predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands against us or such members, officers or experts, respectively. U.S. persons who hold our ordinary shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company. A non-U.S. corporation will generally be considered a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d), for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in any taxable year if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (2) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during such year) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income (\u201cthe PFIC asset test\u201d). For purposes of the PFIC asset test, the value of our assets will generally be determined by reference to our market capitalization. Based on our past and current projections of our income and assets, we do not expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year or for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, a separate factual determination as to whether we are or have become a PFIC must be made each year (after the close of such year). Since our projections may differ from our actual business results and our market capitalization and value of our assets may fluctuate, we cannot assure you that we will not be or become a PFIC in the current taxable year or any future taxable year. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) holds our ordinary shares, such U.S. person may be subject to adverse tax consequences. Each U.S. person who holds our ordinary shares is strongly urged to consult his, her or its tax advisor regarding the application of these rules and the availability of any potential elections. If a U.S. person is treated as owning at least 10% of our ordinary shares, such U.S. person may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences. If a U.S. person is treated as owning (directly, indirectly, or constructively) at least 10% of the total combined voting power of our shares, or of the total value of our shares, such shareholder may be treated as a \u201cUnited States shareholder\u201d with respect to each \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation\u201d in our group (if any). Under changes implemented by the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, because our group includes one or more U.S. subsidiaries, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be treated as controlled foreign corporations (regardless of whether we are treated as a controlled foreign corporation). A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to report annually and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of \u201cSubpart F income,\u201d \u201cglobal intangible low-taxed income,\u201d and investments in U.S. property by controlled foreign corporations, regardless of whether we make any distributions. An individual that is a United States shareholder with respect to a controlled foreign corporation generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a United States shareholder that is a U.S. corporation. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is treated as a controlled foreign corporation or whether any investor is treated as a United States shareholder with respect to any such controlled foreign corporation or furnish to any investor who may be a United States shareholder information that may be necessary to comply with the aforementioned reporting and tax paying obligations. Failure to comply with these reporting obligations may subject a shareholder who is a United States shareholder to significant monetary penalties and may prevent from starting the statute of limitations with respect to such shareholder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax return for the year for which reporting was due. A U.S. person should consult its advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to an investment in our ordinary shares. We may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to Dutch withholding tax, and dividends distributed on our ordinary shares to certain related parties in low-tax jurisdictions might in the future become subject to an additional Dutch withholding tax. We have not paid a dividend on our ordinary shares in the past and we do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. See \u201cRisk Factors-We do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our ordinary shares.\u201d However, if we ever do pay dividends or repurchase shares, then under current Dutch tax law, the dividend paid or repurchase price paid may be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax at a rate of 15% under the Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax Act (Wet op de dividendbelasting 1965, \u201cRegular Dividend Withholding Tax\u201d), unless a domestic or treaty exemption applies. On March 25, 2021, the Dutch State Secretary of Finance submitted a proposal of law to the Dutch parliament pursuant to which an alternative withholding tax (\u201cAlternative Withholding Tax\u201d) will be imposed on dividends paid to related entities in designated low-tax jurisdictions, effective 1 January 2024. An entity is considered related if (i) it has a \u201cQualifying Interest\u201d in our company, (ii) our company has a \u201cQualifying Interest\u201d in the entity holding the ordinary shares, or (iii) a third party has a \"Qualifying Interest\" in both our company and the entity holding the ordinary shares. The term \u201cQualifying Interest\u201d means a direct or indirectly held interest either by an entity individually or jointly if an entity is part of a collaborating group (samenwerkende groep) that enables such entity or such collaborating group to exercise a definite influence over another entities' decisions, such as our company or an entity holding ordinary shares as the case may be, and allows it to determine the other entities' activities. The Alternative Withholding Tax will be imposed at the highest Dutch corporate income tax rate in effect at the time of the distribution (currently 25%). The Alternative Withholding Tax will be reduced, but not below zero, with any Regular Dividend Withholding Tax imposed on distributions. As such, based on currently applicable rates, the overall effective rate of withholding of Regular Dividend Withholding Tax and Alternative Withholding Tax will not exceed the highest corporate income tax rate in effect at the time of the distribution (currently 25%). The proposal of law is subject to amendment during the course of the legislative process and it needs to be approved by both chambers of the Dutch parliament before it can enter into force. If we cease to be a Dutch tax resident for the purposes of a tax treaty concluded by the Netherlands and in certain other events, we could potentially be subject to a proposed Dutch dividend withholding tax in respect of a deemed distribution of our entire market value less paid-up capital. Under a proposal of law currently pending before the Dutch parliament, the Emergency act conditional dividend exit tax (Spoedwet conditionele eindafrekening dividendbelasting \u201cDividend Exit Tax\u201d), we will be deemed to have distributed an amount equal to our entire market capitalization less recognized paid-up capital immediately before the occurrence of certain events, including if we cease to be a Dutch tax resident for purposes of a tax treaty concluded by the Netherlands and become, for purposes of such tax treaty, a tax resident of a non-qualifying jurisdiction. This deemed distribution will be subject to a 15% tax. An automatic interest free unconditional indefinite extension for the full amount of the tax will be granted. However, the extension will expire, inter alia, if and to the extent we make distributions after the taxable event for the purposes of the Dividend Exit Tax (in respect of which the extension is granted). In that event, the Dividend Exit Tax rules prescribe that we will have a right to recover the tax from our shareholders through set-off against their dividend receivable. If we do not recover this amount from our shareholders, we will have to pay such part of the deferred tax ourselves. It is not certain whether the Dividend Exit Tax will be enacted and if so, in what form. If enacted in its present form before the Dutch parliament the Dividend Exit Tax will have retroactive effect from September 18, 2020. General Risk Factors Unfavorable or uncertain conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in information technology spending, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations. Our results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. Current or future economic uncertainties or downturns could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, international trade relations, political instability or unrest and new developments resulting from recent elections and changes of administration, natural catastrophes, warfare, infectious diseases and terrorist attacks on the United States, Europe, the Asia Pacific region or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in business investments by our customers and potential customers, including spending on information technology, and negatively affect the growth of our business. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has curtailed business spending by our customers, resulted in business disruptions for us and/or our customers, restricted travel to customer sites and resulted in a quarantine of affected populations impacting our employees, partners and customers. Additionally, mitigation and containment measures adopted by government authorities to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. and abroad may significantly impact business continuity for our partners and our customers, reduce our customers\u2019 business operations, delay their engagement with us (including due to travel restrictions and restrictions on in-person meetings) and could thereby adversely affect our business and financial results. Further, these measures by government authorities may continue to remain in place for a significant period of time or, even if lifted, could be reinstated at any time, and additional and/or extended measures could significantly impact the ability of our employees and customers and vendors to work productively. To the extent our offerings are perceived by customers and potential customers as discretionary, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology spending. Also, customers may choose to develop in-house software as an alternative to using our products. Moreover, competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown, instability or recovery, generally or within any particular industry. If the economic conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate do not improve, or worsen from present levels, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, or dilute shareholder value. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies, and acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies. We have in the past acquired, and expect in the future to acquire, businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing business, such as our acquisition of Endgame in October 2019. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates is difficult, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete future acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and business strategy, we may be subject to claims or liabilities assumed from an acquired company, product, or technology, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers, investors, and securities analysts. In addition, if we are unsuccessful at integrating Endgame or future acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt our ongoing business and divert management\u2019s attention, and we may not be able to manage the integration process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize acquired technology or personnel, realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction and integration of such acquisition, including accounting charges. We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity or equity-linked securities to pay for any future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our ordinary shares. The sale of equity or issuance of equity-linked debt to finance any future acquisitions could result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. Additionally, we may acquire development stage companies that are not yet profitable, and that require continued investment, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Catastrophic events, or man-made problems such as terrorism, may disrupt our business. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, or significant power outage could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The impact of climate change may increase these risks due to changes in weather patterns, such as increases in storm intensity, sea-level rise, melting of permafrost and temperature extremes in areas where we or our suppliers and customers conduct business. We have a number of our employees and executive officers located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and wildfires. In the event our or our partners\u2019 abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, sales could be delayed, resulting in missed financial targets for a particular quarter. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war, other geo-political unrest or health issues, such as an outbreak of pandemic or epidemic diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or fear of such events, could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our partners, customers or the economy as a whole. Any disruption in the business of our partners or customers that affects sales in a given fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results for that and future quarters. For example, the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the economies of many countries, resulting in economic downturns that could affect demand for our products and likely impact our operating results. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate. See the risk factor entitled \u201cThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could harm our business and results of operations.\u201d If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our ordinary shares. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, measurement of stock-based compensation expense, accounting of intangible assets, goodwill impairment test, and accounting for income taxes including deferred tax assets and liabilities. If industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our ordinary shares, our share price and trading volume could decline, which could adversely affect our business. The trading market for our ordinary shares is influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts, or the content and opinions included in their reports. If any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our company, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, the stock prices of many companies in the technology industry have declined significantly after those companies have failed to meet, or significantly exceed, the financial guidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts or public investors. If our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, our stock price may decline. Further, analysts could downgrade our ordinary shares or publish unfavorable research about us. If one or more of the analysts who cover our company ceases to cover us, or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our visibility in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and could adversely affect our business. The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain senior management and qualified board members. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE and other applicable securities rules and regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased, and we expect will continue increasing our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight is required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Although we have already hired additional personnel to help comply with these requirements, we may need to further expand our legal and finance departments in the future or hire outside consultants, which will increase our costs and expenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and prospects may be harmed. As a result of disclosure of information in the filings required of a public company and in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified senior management or members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit and compensation committees. If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our ordinary shares may decline, which could adversely affect our business. As a public company in the United States, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended and anticipate that we will continue to expend significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. For example, since our IPO, we have hired additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to assist in our compliance efforts. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To assist us in complying with these requirements we may need to hire more employees in the future, or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses. Despite significant investment, our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to implement or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required to be included in our periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, subject us to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, and would likely cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline, which could adversely affect our business."}
{"Risk_Category": "Cybersecurity", "Severity": "High", "Evidence": "The company disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities or incidents.", "source_text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our Common Stock is subject to many risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this \u201cAnnual Report\u201d), including the financial statements and the related notes, before you decide whether to invest in our Common Stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by any of the following risks. The trading price of our Common Stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to the Company We have incurred losses in the past and there can be no assurance that we will operate profitably in the future. Our marketing strategy emphasizes sales of subscription-based services, instead of annual licenses, and using Spokes to connect to our Hubs. This strategy has resulted in the development of a foundation of retail and wholesale Hubs to which suppliers can be \u201cconnected\u201d, thereby accelerating future growth. If, however, this marketing strategy fails, revenue and operations will be negatively affected. We had net income of $4,117,395 for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared to a net income of $1,593,269 for the year ended June 30, 2020. Although we generated net income in the year ended June 30, 2021, there can be no assurance that we will achieve profitability in future periods. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to generate revenue or have sustainable profits. If we do not operate profitably in the future, our current cash resources will be used to fund our operating losses. Continued losses would have an adverse effect on the long-term value of our Common Stock and any investment in the Company. Although our cash resources are currently sufficient, our long-term liquidity and capital requirements may be difficult to predict, which may adversely affect our long-term cash position. Historically, we have been successful in raising capital when necessary, including through private placements, a registered direct offering, and stock issuances to our officers and directors, including our Chief Executive Officer, to pay our indebtedness and fund our operations, in addition to cash flow from operations. If we are required to seek additional financing in the future in order to fund our operations, retire our indebtedness and otherwise carry out our business plan, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and there can be no assurance that any such arrangement, if required or otherwise sought, would be available on terms deemed to be commercially acceptable and in our best interests. Our business is dependent upon the continued services of our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Randall K. Fields. Should we lose the services of Mr. Fields, our operations will be negatively impacted. Our business is dependent upon the expertise and continued service of our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Randall K. Fields. Mr. Fields is essential to our operations. Accordingly, an investor must rely on Mr. Fields\u2019 management decisions that will continue to control our business affairs. We currently maintain key man insurance on Mr. Fields\u2019 life in the amount of $5,000,000; however, that coverage would be inadequate to compensate for the loss of his services. The loss of the services of Mr. Fields would have a materially adverse effect upon our business. Risk Relating to Business Operations Quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate, which makes it difficult to predict future performance. Management expects a significant portion of our revenue stream to come from the sale of subscriptions, and to a lesser extent, transactions processed though MarketPlace, license sales, maintenance and professional services charged to new customers. These amounts will fluctuate and are uncertain because predicting future sales is difficult and involves speculation. In addition, we may potentially experience significant fluctuations in future operating results caused by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including: \u25cf our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements; \u25cf the renewal rates for our subscriptions and other services; \u25cf changes in our pricing policies, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; \u25cf the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new services, including new features to our existing services; \u25cf the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; \u25cf new product and service introductions by our competitors; \u25cf variations in the revenue mix of editions or versions of our service; \u25cf technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; \u25cf general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer\u2019s purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts or affect renewal rates; \u25cf timing of additional expenses and investments in infrastructure to support growth in our business; \u25cf regulatory compliance costs; \u25cf consolidation in the food industry; \u25cf the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; \u25cf extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; \u25cf the impact of new accounting pronouncements; \u25cf the timing of stock awards to employees and the related financial statement impact; and \u25cf system or service failures, security breaches or network downtime. Future operating results may fluctuate because of the foregoing factors, making it difficult to predict operating results. Period-to-period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance. In addition, a large portion of our expense will be fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to facilities and personnel making future operating results sensitive to fluctuations in revenue. We face threats from competing and emerging technologies that may affect our profitability, as well as competitors that are larger and have greater financial and operational resources that may give them an advantage in the market. Markets for our type of software products and that of our competitors are characterized by development of new software, software solutions or enhancements that are subject to constant change; rapidly evolving technological change; and unanticipated changes in customer needs. Because these markets are subject to such rapid change, the life cycle of our products is difficult to predict. As a result, we are subject to the following risks: whether or how we will respond to technological changes in a timely or cost-effective manner; whether the products or technologies developed by our competitors will render our products and services obsolete or shorten the life cycle of our products and services; and whether our products and services will achieve market acceptance. Moreover, many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources than we do. This may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers in the industry, which could result in a loss of potential or current customers or could force us to lower prices. Our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources to the development of new technologies that provide improved operating functionality and features to their product and service offerings. If successful, their development efforts could render our product and service offerings less desirable to customers, again resulting in the loss of customers or a reduction in the price we can demand for our offerings. Any of these actions could have a significant effect on revenue. We face risks associated with new product introductions. Our future revenue is dependent upon the successful and timely development of new and enhanced versions of our products and potential product offerings suitable to the customers\u2019 needs. If we fail to successfully upgrade existing products and develop new products, and those new products do not achieve market acceptance, our revenue will be negatively impacted. It may be difficult for us to assess risks associated with potential new product offerings: \u25cf it may be difficult for us to predict the amount of service and technological resources that will be needed by customers of new offerings, and if we underestimate the necessary resources, the quality of our service will be negatively impacted, thereby undermining the value of the product to the customer; \u25cf technological issues between us and our customers may be experienced in capturing data necessary for new product offerings, and these technological issues may result in unforeseen conflicts or technological setbacks when implementing these products, which could result in material delays and even result in a termination of the engagement; \u25cf a customer\u2019s experience with new offerings, if negative, may prevent us from having an opportunity to sell additional products and services to that customer; \u25cf if customers do not use our products as recommends and/or fail to implement any needed corrective action(s), it is unlikely that customers will experience the business benefits from these products and may, therefore, be hesitant to continue the engagement as well as acquire any other products from us; and \u25cf delays in proceeding with the implementation of new products for a new customer will negatively affect our cash flow and our ability to predict cash flow. We cannot accurately predict renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers\u2019 ability to continue their operations and spending levels, consolidation, and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the level of service at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline, and our business will suffer. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to increase rates, sell additional features and services, or addition subscriptions to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales and marketing efforts that are targeted at senior management. If these strategies fail, we will need to refocus our efforts toward other solutions, which could lead to increased development and marketing costs, delayed revenue streams, and otherwise negatively affect our operations. If our Compliance and Food Safety solutions do not perform as expected, whether as a result of operator error or otherwise, it could impair our operating results and reputation. Our success depends on the food safety market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality reporting for our customers. We believe that our customers are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and operator errors, including if our systems fail to accurately report issues that could reduce the liability of our clients in the event of a product recall. In addition, our reputation and the reputation of our products can be adversely affected if our systems fail to perform as expected. However, if our customers or potential customers fail to implement and use our systems as suggested by us, they may not be able to deal with a recall as effectively as they could have. As a result, the failure or perceived failure of our products to perform as expected, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business. If a customer is sued because of a recalled product we could be joined in that suit, the defense of which would impair our operating results. We believe our Compliance and Food Safety solutions would be helpful in the event of a recall. However, their ultimate usefulness is dependent on how the customer uses our products, which is in many ways out of our control. Similarly, a customer which is a defendant in a product liability case could claim that had our services performed as represented the extent of potential liability would have been minimized and therefore, we should have some contributory liability in the case. Defending such a claim could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business. The deployment of our services, or consultation provided by our personnel, could result in litigation naming us as a party, which litigation could result in a material and adverse effect on us, and our results of operations. Our Compliance and Food Safety solutions are marketed to potential customers based, in part, on our service\u2019s ability to reduce a company\u2019s potential regulatory, legal, and criminal risk from its supply chain partners. In the event litigation is commenced against a customer based on issues caused by a constituent in the supply chain, or consultation provided by our personnel, we could be joined or named in such litigation. As a result, we could face substantial defense costs. In addition, any adverse determination resulting in such litigation could have a material and adverse effect on us, and our results of operations. We face risks relating to the sale and delivery of merchandise to customers. We depend on a number of other companies to perform functions critical to our ability to deliver products to our customers, including maintaining inventory, preparing merchandise for shipment to our customers and delivering purchased merchandise on a timely basis. We also depend on the delivery services that we and they utilize. We also depend on our partners to ensure proper labelling of products. Issues or concerns regarding, product safety, labelling, content or quality could result in consumer or governmental claims. In limited circumstances, we sell merchandise that we have purchased. In these instances, we assume the risks related to inventory. We face risks associated with proprietary protection of our software. Our success depends on our ability to develop and protect existing and new proprietary technology and intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our software, documentation and other written materials primarily through a combination of patents, trademarks, and copyright laws, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. While we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, there are no assurances that we will be successful in doing so. Our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In some types of situations, we may rely in part on \u2018shrink wrap\u2019 or \u2018point and click\u2019 licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult. While we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy our software exists, software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as the United States. We can offer no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not reverse engineer or independently develop similar technology. We may discover software errors in our products that may result in a loss of revenue, injury to our reputation or subject us to substantial liability. Non-conformities or bugs (\u201cerrors\u201d) may be found from time to time in our existing, new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of revenue or injury to our reputation. In the past, we have discovered errors in our products and as a result, have experienced delays in the shipment of products. Errors in our products may be caused by defects in third-party software incorporated into our products. If so, we may not be able to fix these defects without the cooperation of these software providers. Because these defects may not be as significant to the software provider as they are to us, we may not receive the rapid cooperation that may be required. We may not have the contractual right to access the source code of third-party software, and even if we do have access to the code, we may not be able to fix the defect. In addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. Since our customers use our products for critical business applications, any errors, defects or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may result in damage to our customers\u2019 business. If that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. These potential scenarios, successful or otherwise, would likely be time consuming and costly. Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facility could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. We currently serve our customers from a third-party data center hosting facility located in the United States. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. As we continue to add capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers\u2019 data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. Further, any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers\u2019 data is currently replicated in near real-time in a separate facility physically located in a different region of the United States. We do not control the operation of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, our data or our information technology systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time, and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information, such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting our information. The expenses associated with protecting our information could reduce our operating margins. Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. The rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on several factors, including general economic conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. COVID-19 could potentially affect our sales and disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse impact on the Company. The global COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our operations or those of our customers. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations and those of our customers will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. If the public continues to avoid public spaces, including retail stores, or if we, or any of our customers encounter any disruptions to our or their respective operations, facilities or stores, or if our customers were to partially or fully shut down due to COVID-19, then we or they may be prevented or delayed from effectively operating our or their business, respectively, and the marketing and sale of our services and our financial results could be adversely affected. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate in the future, which could result in volatility in our stock price. Our quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors. If our quarterly revenue or results of operations fluctuate, the price of our Common Stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to several factors, including, but not limited to, those listed and identified throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. The limited public market for our stock may adversely affect an investor\u2019s ability to liquidate an investment in us. Although our Common Stock is currently quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market, there is limited trading activity. We can give no assurance that an active market will develop, or if developed, that it will be sustained. If an investor acquires shares of our Common Stock, the investor may not be able to liquidate our shares should there be a need or desire to do so. Future issuances of our shares may lead to future dilution in the value of our Common Stock, will lead to a reduction in shareholder voting power and may prevent a change in control. The shares may be substantially diluted due to the following: \u25cf issuance of Common Stock in connection with funding agreements with third parties and future issuances of Common Stock and the Company\u2019s Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 (\u201cPreferred Stock \u201d) by the Board of Directors; and \u25cf the Board of Directors has the power to issue additional shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock and the right to determine the voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation, preferences and other conditions of the shares without shareholder approval. Stock issuances may result in reduction of the book value or market price of outstanding shares of Common Stock. If we issue any additional shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, proportionate ownership of Common Stock and voting power will be reduced. Further, any new issuance of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may prevent a change in control or management. Our officers and directors have significant control over us, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate governance. Our officers and directors control approximately 41% of our Common Stock. Randall K. Fields, our Chief Executive Officer, controls 34% of our Common Stock. Consequently, Mr. Fields, individually, and our officers and directors, as stockholders acting together, can significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as mergers or other business combination transactions. Our corporate charter contains authorized, unissued \u201cblank check\u201d Preferred Stock issuable without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting then current stockholder interests. Our articles of incorporation currently authorize the issuance of up to 30,000,000 shares of \u2018blank check\u2019 Preferred Stock with designations, rights, and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors, of which 700,000 shares are currently designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries B Preferred\u201d) and 550,000 shares are designated as Series B-1 Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries B-1 Preferred\u201d). As of June 30, 2021, a total of 625,375 shares of Series B Preferred and 212,402 shares of Series B-1 Preferred were issued and outstanding. Our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more additional series of Preferred Stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting, or other rights that could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, our Common Stockholders. The issuance of an additional series of Preferred Stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control. We have not paid dividends on our Common Stock, and investors should consider the potential for us to pay dividends on our Common Stock as a factor when determining whether to invest in us. We have not paid dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends pertaining to our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of our business. Our Board of Directors will determine our future dividend policy at their sole discretion, and future dividends will be contingent upon future earnings, if any, obligations of the stock issued, our financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors. Future dividends may also be affected by covenants contained in loan or other financing documents, which we may executed in the future. Therefore, there can be no assurance that dividends will ever be paid on our Common Stock. Our officers and directors have limited liability and indemnification rights under our organizational documents, which may impact our results. Our officers and directors are required to exercise good faith and high integrity in the management of our affairs. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, however, provide that the officers and directors shall have no liability to the stockholders for losses sustained or liabilities incurred which arise from any transaction in their respective managerial capacities unless they violated their duty of loyalty, did not act in good faith, engaged in intentional misconduct or knowingly violated the law, approved an improper dividend or stock repurchase or derived an improper benefit from the transaction. As a result, an investor may have a more limited right to action than he would have had if such a provision were not present. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws also require us to indemnify our officers and directors against any losses or liabilities they may incur as a result of the manner in which they operate our business or conduct our internal affairs, provided that the officers and directors reasonably believe such actions to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, and their conduct does not constitute gross negligence, misconduct or breach of fiduciary obligations."}
